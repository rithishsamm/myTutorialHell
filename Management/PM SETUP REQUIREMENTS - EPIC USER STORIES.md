KISS FRAMEWORK: 

(Daily Standup progress tracking:)
Project1 - Hexr Daily - **Standup Update:**
- **Retrospective** - Translating all the product requirements, user stories, tickets, case studies to -> Issue types (Task, Story, Bugs, Epics, User Story, Issue, Todo lists).
- **Assigning Tasks and Service tickets** - Each of the tasks to the relevent teams and members (PM -> TL -> TM)
- **Follow-up Progress Tracking** - Weekly Scrum followup on existing Issues 
- **Managing and resolving** - timeline / deadline collapse with the load of existing and currently assigned tasks 
- **Review**ing and verifying the completion of completed tasks, reassign if not satisfy the same.
- **Advancing** - Proceed each and deliver the collectibles to the relevant entity - next step further to do the same.

Project2 - **Dwinzo:**
**Work Package 1 - Factory builder:** Customers can be able to build a digital twin replica of their factory/ industrial space or setup
- **Draw** - Customers can be able to build a digital twin replica of their factory/ industrial space or setup
- **Create** - Customers can be able to drag and drop building parts, machineries, equipment's, factories and assets. 
- **Measure Sizes** - Customers should be able to accurately able to do measurements and calculate size and spaces of each.
- **Edit** - Customer must be able to do CRUD operations while setting up the same. Making things editable as per customer's convenience.
- **View** - Customers should be able to view and present the digital replica setup of their factory in different views and angles.
- **Upload** - Customer must be able to import and export their files, assets, environment in different relevant file format that supports.
- **Save** - Customer must be able to record the view, share via different mediums, save it and should be able download the setup locally.

**Work Package 2 - Process Creator:** Customer can be able to enable functionalities to create the manufacturing process of that factory setup. 
- **Home except panel  -** 
-- Transform - able to place or replace an object, 
-- Rotate - able to rotate an object, 
-- Scale - Scaling an object, To make it bigger or smaller.  
- **Process Outliner** (+with an add button)  
-- Object placeholder for adding functionality to it to turn it up as a process listing each,  
-- Process Dropdown
-- Search bar - to find, sort and filter the same
-- Hide or Lock Option for the process
- **Animation -**
-- Animation Modal - Play with UI, Play without UI - Coupled with Process Timeline bar playing the process  Visible - Checkbox,
-- Path, Ref - Select all - button
- **Properties** -  shows Position, Rotation and Scale in  X, Y, Z axis  - just a calculative viewer
- **Process Timeline Viewer - Objects as layers** - Fast Backward, Backward, Play/pause, Forward, Fast Forward -> Current Tim: 10s and Max Time: 10s

**Work Package 3 - RT Viz:** Customer can be able to visualize the manufacturing process in real time with the digital twin mimicking the real world process irl with the same that we created with the Factory builder and Process Creator
- **Left Asset Panel**  - Object Library showing Process info, Object type and widget.
- **Node Editor** - Visualize processes as node, from both the server or local viewport -> Here to edit the same. 
- **From Server** - Fetch Processes from Server
- **From Viewport** - Fetch Processes from viewport
- **Templates** - Load Prebuilt or preloaded Template for RT Viz

**Work Package 4 - Simulator:** Customer can be able to run simulation the manufacturing process to rectify and fine tuning setup, structure and the overall working process. 
- **Nodes** - Search bar, list of Process nodes  
- **Add Simulation** - Different type of simulations adding one on one
- **Node Flow** - Options: Play, Clear, Clear/ Accessibility: Zoom in and out, Full View, lock
- **Node Specs -** Reset Node, Naming the node, Labeling the node, Naming an input and Setting up process time for it. 

**Work Package 5 - ERP:** Customer able to place orders and can see the current status of the manufacturing process from raw material to furnished product and the queue of their order status and predictive order delivery getting that to supply chain. 
- **View Process -** Show Realtime manufacturing process of the queued orders
- **Order Queue -** Order queue info, the orders that are processing in due
- **Place Order** - Select Products and placing orders to checkout to start their batch 
- **View Order Status** - Showing customer's placed order 
- **Delivery ETA** - Expected estimated time of order delivery

**Work Package 6 - Framework** - 
- **Features Dropdown** - Factory Builder, Process Creator, RT Viz, Simulator
- **User** - User side section to satisfy their requirement. Regular section
- **Organization** - Admin Side section, to administrate and manage users
- **User Management** - IAM - providing authorization and permissions for assessing features
- **Order Details** - Status - accessing ERP section
- **Profile Settings** - Profile Settings, Change profile photo, username, password, 2FA
- **Log Out** - Killing a session
