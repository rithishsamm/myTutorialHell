#### Introduction:
Good day! Here's a little introduction. 

Myself rithishsamm, Working as a DevOps Engineer in an early stage product based startup. There are two projects is under development. MERN and more subsequent technologies that is powering these products is the stack. 

For these two projects, One project is a team of 15 members, other one is 6 members. 

**A glimpse of the products.** 
1) One will fall under digital twin concept. A factory simulation product to visualize, simulate, and optimize manufacturing processes in real time for operational efficiency.
2) One is a GIS product that helps urban planning and design of buildings and estates. 

All these includes running Realtime simulation, blueprinting projects, process visualization, integration, maintenance monitoring, observability etc.

this is a rough overview about the companies and the projects. 

Here, I am wearing multiple hats doing the DevOps work, managing Developer and Operations relations, Project management adapting Agile DevOps Methodologies to keep the SDLC running, systems and infrastructure (hybrid) and more

#### Context:
Since we are at an early stage, We are about to build the whole culture from scratch. So far, all the dev's are managing all the products using Git for Version Control and Gitea platform for Source Code Management. 

Each of the services has been developed and maintained individually. I will be taking each of it and running it in a multi-container environment in our internal development server.

###### *Problem*:
So far so good.

Here, I've happened to face several issues due to some concerns. These concerns are the problem that must be address in prior which might end up as a critical and alarming concern for our organization's near future if it isn't addressed.  
###### *Requirement*:
Need a consultation on all these concerns:
1) Communication - Best practices of delivering product requirement documents (PRDs) to the developers
2) Collaboration - Updates and Documentation of the services/programs/ that the developers have developed which has to be properly communicated with the rest of the relevant teams. Communication between the teams is lacking here. 
(ended up having compatibility issues, version issues, services integrations issues, lack of insights about the services that got built, lack of insights after delivery, lack of setup instructions after delivery, conflicting and unsupported packages)
3) Documentation: Patching and Update Documentation. what has been changed and how it is changed, what and has to be taken to consideration, setup and more.
#### Required Solution:
All the above mentioned requirements. 
1) How to adapt to such environment
2) What are all the tools can be used for project management. appropriate tools for the use cases.
3) Best practices embracing team communication and collaboration to move forward and grow the same in the future.

#### Objective:
1) Streamlining organizational structure,
2) Project Management
3) Enabling team communication and collaboration,
4) declutter the tied up knots, preventing bottlenecks and roadblocks
5) Enabling proof of work, accountability, error identification and mapping
6) Raising issues, tickets to take up the charge for their actions
7) Enhancing Developers, Stakeholders and Operation's relationship. 
8) Going and being Agile.
9) Setting up standards and follow essential practices to maintain culture.
