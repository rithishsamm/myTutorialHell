### Jira for Beginners
We'll go through everything you need to know so you can use Jira the fast way.
We're first going to do a refresher on 
- agile Concepts and 
- Jira terms and then we'll dive into the 
- Jira interface 
-- creating your very first project and 
-- setting up Jira issues 
-- user stories and 
-- bugs 
and then we're going to 
- set up your projects labels 
- components and 
- versions 
and finally 
- how to groom and 
- prioritize it items in your backlog and 
- set up your very first Sprint 

so if you're a complete beginner and you have never used Jira before then watch this  tutorial from beginning to the end.

to follow along with this tutorial I created my free guide with how to use Jira and it contains all the data that we're going to use to create our project in this Jira.

Questions:
1) what is your biggest struggle with Jira and 
2) what questions do you have about using Jira to manage your agile projects

**==Jira is one of the most popular software tools used to manage agile projects==**. **but before we can start using Jira you must understand how agile works.** because Jira assumes that you already know it.
Specifically with a two popular methodologies of **SCRUM** and **KANBAN**, not a deep dive into agile but quick refresher so you can start using Jira the fast way.


### Agile Concepts:

==**What is Agile?**
Agile is a methodology that uses an iterative approach to develop a product 
building and releasing it incrementally,
instead of trying to deliver everything to the customer at the very end of a project 
like you would a traditional waterfall approach ==

Agile promotes early delivery and focuses on adapting to changing requirements as you obtain customer feedback during every single iteration,
underneath the agile umbrella are two popular methodologies we have 
- scrum 
- Kanban
these both have different workflows and templates that exist inside of Jira.

there is one difference and that has to do with a box period of time as known as a 
- Sprints are used here to develop the product in the scrum framework while
- Kanban does not use Sprints 

==**What is sprint?**
a Sprint is an amount of time that the team commits to completing their work and delivering a working product by the end of it. ==
eg:  let's say that we Define our Sprint to be weeks - Two weeks sprint. 
At the beginning of the Sprint, the team holds what's called a **Sprint planning meeting**, where the entire team discusses and agrees upon what are all the work can be completed in the next two weeks.

the team also discusses 
- how much effort it's going to take to complete these **Items** and 
- they put these items into what's called a **Sprint backlog** 
Sprint Backlog?
-- is a prioritized list of items for the team to work on for the next 2 weeks and every single day during your Sprint the team holds a **daily scrum** or **a quick 15minute meeting** to review the team's **Review Progress** and **Roadblocks** on their assigned items in the Sprint backlog and  

at the very end of the Sprint, the team presents the developed product to the product owner or the customer for their review and their feedback 

##### Scrum:
Let's go through a high level example of a Sprint workflow using's JIRA's Scrum Sprint Template,
this is a scrum board inside of Jira broken up into four columns,
- To-do 
- In-progress
- Testing
- Done
eg: In our to-do column, we have three tasks that the team needs to complete during the Sprint,
Todo: (Tasks)
 1: code the user interface 
 2: fix a bug that's related to the payment screen and 
 3: create the database schema 
**the goal of the Sprint is to take all items through each column until they reach the done column and by the end of the two weeks were we able to complete all the items on our scrum board**. 
and if not what Roadblocks we have during the Sprint that prevented us from actually doing that.

Now this scrum board can look different for every team and some teams. They may actually want to have more statuses or different columns than the default. In general, this is a very high level overview with scrum. 

##### Kanban:
Now, some teams prefer to use the Kanban approach. Because, they don't work best within a time box period of time for let's say 2 weeks. For such instance with Kanban workflow, you'll be using a similar board like the one I'm showing from earlier for scrum where the goal is to do everything you can to push all items from **todo** list to **done**. Now, instead of planning work in a time box iteration,

Kanban uses what's called a **PULL SYSTEM** to simply just move those cards throughout process each time the team completes an item of work. 
it triggers a pull to bring in the next item that they're going to work on.
Since there will usually be what's called a **work in progress** or **whip** limit for each column on the combine board whenever there's an empty slot on the board.

**that's a signal for the team to pull work from the previous columns as long as there are items available.** so in general for Kanban, work is continuously being pulled from the left to the right side of the board. 

#### Agile Terms 
###### Scrum - Projects > Epics + User Stories:
So with the scrum methodology, it breaks down a project into smaller bits of user functionality which are known as epics and user stories.

and these will be the most common types that you're going to create for your projects inside of Jira.

==**Issue:**
which are just work **items or tickets** that require an action from a person. every ticket that you create in Jira is known as an **issue**.==

==**What is Epic?**
 Epic is a large body of work that cannot be completed inside of one Sprint== and 
 usually your team will break this epic up into multiple users user stories 

==**What is a User Story?**
 a user story is a story represents a feature or a capability that needs to be created. a brief sentence that describes the desired capability of the product from the perspective of the end user hence the name user story.==  
 A User story format is as a user type, **I want some capability so that a benefit can be achieved**. 

 when all user stories are completed underneath an epic then the Epic itself is completed. Eg: if you're building a shopping software app, then the
**Jira project:** shopping software application, underneath that we could have an 
**epic**: shopping cart interface and one of the 
**user stories** within that epic: a customer I want to check out items for my shopping cart so that I can purchase my items.

now in this example the role is from the customer's POV, the desired capability: check out items from your shopping cart and 
is to purchase the items.

![[Pasted image 20241105173652.png]]

so in Jira, you're going to have multiple user stories linked underneath one Epic for the shopping interface functionality and I've listed a few examples of user stories that are associated with this epic.

**some of these user stories might be completed in one Sprint.** 
>so in general this is how the agile methodology breaks down a project into smaller pieces of work that can be done over iterations.

### How Jira works 
**after you sign up with a free Jira account, it will ask you to create a website which is what will store all of your projects within your organization.**

![[Pasted image 20241105181733.png]]

Jira operates with the following hierarchical structure. 
1) **Top**: (name.atlassian.url):
-- At the very top is your Jira account **instance** which is the website name you created, when you initially signed up to Atlassian.

2) Next: (projects Section):
-- underneath this, these are the different projects, which are associated with the different products software applications or services that your team is developing to set up your projects and everything that's inside of Jira you create what are known as **issues.** (which are just work items or tickets that require an action from a person. every ticket that you create in Jira is known as an issue). Each of these JIRA issues will be under epic sections.

3) Epic: (Issues Section):
Underneath a project are your epics (which is the largest chunk of work that you can have and they're used to categorize your work) so EPIC = the highly features of your product.
Eg: 
user account management 
shopping interface module or 
product search optimization, 
Here, these epics. **they help us align the product that we're creating to certain features and product goals**. 

Epics typically span several weeks to complete and they should be a large piece of work and should not be something that can be done in 1 to three days. 

4) Issues:
Underneath these EPICs, Jira has other issue types as follows
**Epics:**
- Story
- Bug
- Task

	**story:** 
	you can create the first is a story what's also known as a user story which we reviewed earlier and they represent few functionality to be built for your product
	
	**bug**: (or a defect) 
	which was discovered in a previously completed user story that was thought to be quote unquote done and the next.
	
	**task:** (or work) 
	that's required to get an item to be done.
	
	**subtask:**
	in the lowest level of this hierarchy. subtasks are found underneath a story so that the team thinks or know carefully about what work actually needs to be done and ideally should be completed in one day or less 

so,  as an example when you're
**Jira** -> **Log In** (Sample Project) -> **Create** button(on the blue)  -> **Project:** modal pops up, with the selected project -> **Issue Types** (four can be found at the Middle top portion) -> where all those issue types can be found, which is
- task
- story
- bug or
- an epic 
-> and we're going to go through this in much more detail later in this tutorial. 

#### Creating your Jira Account 
Now that you understand how Jira set up. 

I want you to sign up and create a free account with the Jira. along the way, you can follow along step by step so we can create an agile project from beginning to the end.  creating your own free JIRA account that's separate from the company that you work gives you own admin access to create projects and you'll have much more leeway with what you can do and you'll have a lot more privileges with how you can set things up inside of Jira.

#### Mastering the Jira Interface 
note: UI drastically changes in the future but overall the idea and the functionalities behind all these are the same.

**Step 1:** Understanding the JIRA Interface:

>**Jira**(logo) -> **Your Work** (home) -> **Projects** -> **Project Name** (as a card in recent section or in the quick links) -> in that card below, there will be -> Board (that got created for this project) -> Scrum Board.

to a filter or a project, it's going to appear in this list now Pro tip for me if you're working on several projects at once I recommend starring them so they show up right here and it's going going to help speed up tremendously your workflow and productivity. 

#### How to setup a project in Jira
**Step 2:** Creating the very first project using **SCRUM** approach:
**Project**: developing an Ecommerce shopping software application (will follow the scrum approach to develop the same)

>**Jira**(logo) -> **Projects** (dropdown) -> **Create Project** -> **Template** (for different categories/department) -> (Software development + Scrum) -> **Project Type** (managed by team which is simple or company is more advanced) -> **Company Managed** -> **Project Details** (name: ecom-shop-app, key: ESA) -> **Next** ->  Voila! (successfully created scrum project inside JIRA)

```
Written draft of these steps:
to create a project move your mouse to the projects tab at the top of your screen and left click it in the new popup menu click on the button on the very bottom of the menu called create project at last will now ask you to use a specific template to create your project and on

the left hand side are different templates that we can use such as software development service management for it work management for tracking tasks marketing product management human resources and the list just goes on the templates that you use will be preset and customize how your workflow will appear inside of Jira so let's go back to the templates for software development two of the most common ones are  Kanban or scrum  Kanban where you can track your work using a simple board and you can limit the work of progress and

if we go back and we choose the scrum template then we can plan our upcoming work inside of a backlog and we can organize our cycles of work into what's known as Sprints so for our project example let's click on the button for use template for using scrum now what we'll see is we have to choose the project type is it going to be a team managed project or will it be a company manage project so the team manage project will only have the essential features it'll have a much more simplified configuration and it will be more limiting so to give us the most flexibility with our configuration and so we can set up everything ourselves let's choose the company manage project and we'll click on the bottom the blue button at the very bottom of the screen now we're at this screen where we have to input our project details so for every project that you have to create you need to set up is Project name and its unique key so that it can be easily referenced throughout Jira for our project name let's call it e-commerce shopping app so the project key consists of a few letters that you'll be seeing whenever you're working throughout Jira it can be anything but usually you want to name your key a few letters so it's easy to track and remember your issues within your project for our example let's name our key Esa that way it's really easy to remember and see  hroughout your Jira project now let's click on the next button so so far we've added our project name our project key we've selected the template for scrum and we've chosen the company managed project type so now let's click on the next button 
```
#### Navigating your Project in Jira 
Step 3: Navigating the Project:

all right so now that we've clicked the next button. **==we have officially created our scrum project for our project inside of Jira.==**

Now the first screen that we're seeing right here is for 
1) the active Sprints which we'll call as the scrum board (all the todo, in progress and done columns)
2) Jira calls it by its `own` that's named based upon our `project key` for our project or our e-commerce shopping app.
![[Pasted image 20241106110128.png]]

3) in the scrum board, Jira already creates your board with three columns
- todo 
- in-progress
- done
- (also you can add more columns based on your convenience)
![[Pasted image 20241106110335.png]]

4) here if we set up our Sprints, we will be seeing our **user stories, task and bugs** that we need to complete for the Sprint populated within these three columns 
5) goal here is: to get all user stories all the way to the done column (by taking things from `to do`and then moving it to `in progress` and finally to `done` )
6) we can transition any item from one status to the next

 Also, this Scrum board is highly customizable. ,
 
So far at this point, we don't see much going on here. We're not seeing any information populated inside of our scrum board. 
Because we haven't created any data yet and out Sprint has not yet started.

###### Navigating Left side panel
Now, the left side panel, have
1) **Panel: (Active Sprints)** 
Different options to view and visualize the project status.
>Pro tip: you can easily collapse or expand this left panel by either pressing this left Arrow key and then repressing again or 
>==**keyboard shortcut `[`  - FOR MAXXING THE VIEW**==
>helps maximize the  viewing window when I'm reviewing my projects efficiently

2) Backlog: 
Now, above active Sprints, we have the **backlog** - where we'll be adding in and creating all of our issues for our 
- epics 
- user stories
- tasks and
- bugs

In this backlog section right here, this is where the product owner/manager will be managing and grooming the agenda or action items.

Here, this backlog is how you're going to see work that's coming up to you in terms of priorities 

> THE **BACKLOG** AND **ACTIVE SPRINTS** WILL BE ACTIVELY / FREQUENTLY USED WHEN WE WORK WITH JIRA

EG: Here, in the scrum board interface in the Active Sprint Section, 
>==**keyboard shortcut `1, 2`  - To toggle between Active Sprint and Backlog**==

#### Project Overview & Jira Data

For our Scrum, 
>**the goal is to develop a software that allows customers to search for and buy products from the physical retail store using their phone** 

so, The synopsis will be by steps following below,
**Step: 1 (EPICS)**
we're going to have seven epics as part of building this software. we'll have 
**EPICS:** 
- the shopping cart
- cancelling orders 
- user accounts 
- shopping interface 
- product search
- loyalties program and 
- shopping location 

**Step 2: (Deconstructing Epics to Tasks)**
and underneath these different epics, 
![[Pasted image 20241106154220.png]]

we're going to have different 
- user stories and 
- some tasks and 
separate from this we're going to also add a few
- bugs 
into our Jira Project.

Step 3: (Work)
With all these, will briefly understand how to do a Sprint by tracking and resolving these projects. 

###### Creating First Epic
Let's create our first epic called **shopping cart** and then 
we'll add our user stories and tasks to it later. to do that, let's go to our **Backlog** module 
to create our epic.

**To create an Epic (have to raise issue ticket):** 
> Jira -> Project -> Project Name -> (if lands in sprint, navigate to) Backlog -> Create (to create issues) -> (opens a dialog box) -> Project (select one) -> Issue Type (dropdown) -> (select) Epic -> (status default To-Do -> Epic name (to have a timeline) -> Summary (short and simple, as same as epic name) -> Parent (entity that school the following actions)-> Components (tech stack, programs and more) -> Description -> Versions -> Priority -> Team -> Labels -> Attachement -> Linkedin Issues -> Assign (Assign epic to co-work) -> Sprint -> Create

1. to create an **issue**. to do that, go to backlog -> click on the blue create button ->
2. it's going to open up this dialogue box -> have to fill out all for this issue under a project 
3. after that, you'll see that we have four available type to us,
-  task
- story 
- bug or
- epic 
choose an **`epic`** for now.
4. After that, let the `to do` be default, 
5. Epic name - Name the epic for easy to identify. eg: shopping cart 
6. Summary name - eg: shopping cart (I recommend keeping your short and simple, because this summary is what you're going to see within your backlog)
7. Parent - (here, the EPIC itself is a parent).
but when we create our user stories and our tasks later on. that's when we'll put this underneath the parent for the Epic.
8. Components - features / programs that get created under the same
9. Description - we can add some detail about the Epic.
eg: defining the functionality for the shopping cart interface for checking out and
purchasing items.
10. Reporter -  who is creating this issue which in our case is me
11. Priority -Set priority of this Epic - medium, highest, high, low and lowest (will see more in brief when we create our user stories and tasks)
12. Labels - a way for us to categorize your issues, so it's easy to filter and search for specific user stories
13. Linked issues - an issue is connected to or dependent upon another issue 
14. Assign - Assign the epic to self or others (automatic is the default)
15. Sprint -  Active Sprints
16. Create - we have created an Epic (where we created an issue ticket)

Here in the backlog screen, the epics do not immediately appear. because, they reside within the epics panel. To ope an epic panel,
>==**keyboard shortcut `e`  for epic  - To open EPICS**==
17. Epic -> Dropdown Menu. (optionally, hide/collapse left panel for more space), 

>**why this clutter?** 
>Epic is epic which is superior, one level above the user where the rest of them are below it. 
>here, since it is backlog space which is opted for the user stories, tasks and bugs 

The Epic we created shown on the left panel, will create six of them which we intended to. 
Let's add another epic by clicking on the plus sign create epic underneath it for our second epic let's create one for cancelling orders and we'll type that into the Epic name and summary all right so now we've created two epics for our project let's go ahead and let's create the remaining five epics first is for the user account epic all all right so for the first epic that we'll create let's call it user account

epic let's copy and paste into the summary and at the very bottom of the screen there's a check mark for create another issue let's make sure that's actually check marked so that way it speeds up the process for creating our epics and our future issues click on

Create and then you'll see a notification at the very bottom that one issue was created let's do another epic for shopping interface when you do that make sure that you update the summary and the Epic name so they're both updated so we can see that
the Epic name and summary has been updated to reflect shopping interface and then we'll click on create again it'll show that two issues have now been created so let's repeat this again for creating the Epic for product search in both the Epic name and
summary let's click on Create and each time you'll see that the

number at the bottom also increases as well so at this point we have now created three issues or three epics for our project now let's create our next Epic for the loyalties program let's click create and then let's type in the next epic for shopping
Location we're making sure that we're typing in shopping location both into the Epic name and summary let's click create and then we'll see that we've now created

Five epics or five issues for our project let's click on the x button at the very top let's click discard issue and now we can see that we have populated these issues within our project so we have shopping cart cancelling orders user account shopping interface product search loyalties program and shopping location let's take a closer look at one of these so let's click on the arrow that that's next to shopping cart what you'll see is underneath it we see the key for the Epic we also see how many issues are associated with this epic we also see how many have been completed as well as an estimate of the number of story points that are required to complete this epic let's click on view

details and what we're going to have is a separate panel open up on the right hand side and this will show all the details that we've entered in so far for this epic in the top row of icons we can attach a file to this epic we can add a child issue underneath this epic or we can link an issue underneath it or another website or page or even Confluence and right below it we have the status of this epic and right now it's showing that we're in too and then we have the description box right below it which is what we type in earlier and right below it are the different details tied to this epic so we have who the person is assigned to the reporter or The person who created it we also have labels and its priority there are other fields below this as well so we have story points original estimate time tracking components Sprint and fix versions all issues whether it's a story

a task or a bug will have similar feel this for an epic so just something to keep in mind Pro tip from me there is a color box icon that's next to the Epic name I encourage you to color code your epics so that it's easier for you to visually identify your epics and group them together so let's do that right now sensor epics for shopping cart cancelling orders shopping interface and product search are all associated with shopping for product items let's color code these all a similar bluish or dark Teal color now they don't all have to be the same bluish color just as long as they have roughly the same color Hue and [Music]

intensity all right so now we've colorcoded the epex for shopping cart cancelling orders shopping interface and product search and that way it's a little bit easier for for us to identify which one is associated with a specific functionality so now let's color call the epics for user account and loyalties program an orange-ish color because they're associated with the user admin side of things so for user account let's choose the color for orange all right so for loyalties program let's go in let's view details and let's change the color of this to also a different slightly maybe like a dark yellow color as well and lastly for the Epic for shopping location let's color Cod it a red color since it's tied

to store information and voila now we've already color coded all the different epics so it's a little bit more visually easier to identify and categorize each epic based upon its category now before we start creating our issues within our project make sure to smash that like like button if you're getting any value out of this  tutorial and to subscribe to the channel for more  tutorials like this all right so let's go ahead and create the user stories for our epics starting with our first epic for the shopping cart so going back to our Jira project to create an issue you can either click the blue create button at the top of your screen or you can press the keyboard shortcut button for C and then this window will appear so inside this dialogue box you can see that we're underneath the project for eCommerce shopping app and the issue that we want to create right now is for a story so let's select that for now the status of course will be to do

since we haven't yet started the Sprint and for the summary I'm going to type in the user story for checking out items in the shopping cart all right so we have the summary in there right now so we have as a customer I want to check out the items from my shopping cart so that I can pay from my selected items for the parent link this is where we want to choose the Epic for the shopping cart all right so let's choose the one for shopping cart Esa -1 and for the description I like to use this space to define the acceptance criteria that you'll agree upon with your team 

let's copy what I have already pre-written from my guide and let's paste it into here all right so that looks good let's leave everything else as is and then let's click the blue create button we can see right away that our new user story for checking out items from my shopping cart has been added inside of our backlog so let me explain what each part of this row is inside of the back back log the first icon at the very left is the box that tells you what kind of issue type it is so in this case this icon right here represents the user story next we have our issue key which is just the project key itself Esa for Ecommerce shopping app followed by the issue number so the number eight and to the right of this we have the issue summary being displayed in one line and to the right of the summary we have the f type that this falls under which in this example is for the shopping cart the next column is for the status of this user story which is to do the gray Circle towards the very right is the number of story points that your team

estimates that it would take to complete this user story and that's what you typically do during your Sprint planning meeting we haven't filled this information out so let's leave it as blank and then we have the priority level of lowest low low high and highest and then to the right of that we have the person who this issue is assigned to if you want to let's say view the details of this issue left click the summary of the issue and all the details will appear on the right panel to the right if you want to open up the issue in a separate window then left click the issue number that's next to the icon so left click Esa d8 and it should appear in a separate tab now we can see all of the details of this user story in a much larger viewing window you'll see everything that we entered in for the description so the acceptance criteria that we typed in as well as all the details on the right hand side as well as activities so the comments history of what's happened to this user story and worklog if any specific users track in their work so for now let's go back to our backlog since we do have several more user stories that we need to create there is another way to quickly create issues and that is by clicking on the plus create issue button that is at the backlog section so making sure that none of the epics are selected let's click on the plus create issue button for now let's add in the next user story for reviewing items in the cart so now that we've edited in press enter

so now we've entered that in and what you'll notice is that you'll have to fill in any of the other details that we typically filled out previously at a later time period because we do have to assign still the Epic and all the other labels as well so in general this is a
very quick way to create issues but you will have to go back to each issue and add in the appropriate descriptions and details at a later time for now let me input the remaining user stories that are a part of our project and you can follow along as I do

this so now we've added in all of our user stories let's add in a few bugs to the project so we can also visualize how this would look during a Sprint you'll notice that when I click on the plus create issue button here you can change the issue type to be the bug which in this case is just a red box with a white circle to indicate that it is a bug so
let's repeat this and I'll copy and paste all the other bug types for this project so now we've added in all of the user stories and all the bugs now let's say that for our very first user story for checking out items from the shopping cart we have several subtests that we want want to keep track of so let's open this up in a separate tab so we can have a closer look at this let's say that we have several subtest that we want to keep track of so to add those subtests to this user story click on the create subtask button which is right below the user Story summary line once you do that this separate line will appear for subtask so now let's input several subtests that we believe are required to complete this un user story I'm going to press enter and it will create the subtask automatically let's do this again for the remaining

subtask for this user story all right pressing return for the last subtask and now we're done and so you can see here that we have a full  list of subtasks which are tied directly
 to this user story so let's go back to our backlog and let let's refresh the page so we can see what it looks like so when we go back to the backlog we can see that with this user story selected we can see all the sub test that we just inputed on the right hand panel now let's add another group of subtask for our third user story for updating the number of items inside of our shopping cart I'm going to open this up in a separate tab that way it's a little bit easier for us to type in and and enter in all of his subtasks so let's do that right now all right so with that completed we have now inputed all the different subtests for this third user story so with that completed let's go back to our

finalized backlog let's click the refresh button at the top so it shows all the latest data now this is a long list of user stories and the idea here is to get you familiarized and used to seeing different kinds of isue types within a backlog for your jro project since we created our issues the fast way using the plus create issue row at the very bottom it doesn't assign the issues to the appropriate epics so we need to take care of that right now so to assign a user story to an epic all you have to do is left click one user story and then drag and drop it to the appropriate epic in the Epic panel on the left side so for the second user story of reviewing items inside your cart let's select it left click it drag and drop into the shopping cart epic once you do that you'll notice that the shopping cart epic has now been attached to this user story now if there's a group of issues that fall under the same epic category then you can do this very quickly by left clicking the chat Mark box to the left of the issue and repeating it for multiple issues and then dragging and dropping them into the appropriate epic label let's do that for the first epic for the shopping cart and voila all of them automatically update to the shopping cart epic all right and so let's do this for the remaining user stories and their

corresponding epics for the cancelling orders epic we have these two which need to be assigned to the Epic for cancelling orders the next group is for the Epic for user account and so it'll start with the user story for logging into my account all the way down to changing my password so let's drag and drop it into the user account epic and you can see that the Epic categor slowly start to populate across all the different user stories with different labels here the next category is for the shopping interface so let's start with the viewing the products available in the store all the way down to viewing which physical store location that you want to see so let's drag and drop it into the shoping interface epic let's unselect those and then we'll choose the ones for the Epic for product search so starting from the top here I want to search for items available in the store and let's go all the way down to showing personalized results of products that I'm inter interested in let's drag and drop this and put this into the product search epic all right now all that's remaining is for the loyalties program and shopping location epic so we have I want to get discount coupons I want to receive an anniversary discount and

refer a friend bonus discounts let's drag and drop it into the loyalties program right now all right and then we have these three remain in user stories and these are all tied to the shopping location epic all right everything is looking pretty good so far all right so now we've assigned all of the appropriate issues to their corresponding epics and you can see their epic category in the right side column here Pro tip from me each issue that you create in your backlog should only correspond to one Epic that way this ensures that the work that your team is performing is aligned with the product vision and what the team is trying to build during the Sprint now a really cool feature with Jira is how easy it is to filter and quickly see which items correspond to an epic so on the left epic panel when you click on shopping cart for example you will only see the issues that are associated with the Epic for the shopping cart if you want to see other issues underneath the other epics then you have to left click the Epic label again that way it deselects it and then you can repeat the process so you can quickly see which user stories are assigned to a different epic so for example these are all the user stories

tied to shopping interface for loyalties program here are all the different user stories that are assigned to it and of course here are the ones for product search so again it's very helpful and it's very easy to quickly identify which user stories are tied to the appropriate epic so by this point we have populated our entire backlog or what's known as our product backlog that will be used to develop our e-commerce shopping software app we have created several epics that are linked to different user stories
tasks and bugs and we have color coded each epic so that they're easier to identify and filter now let's take a look at how you can categorize your issues using what's called labels so

it's easier for you to identify and search for them in your project and  later on you'll be able to filter out your issues based on these labels now think of a label as a onew piece of text to categorize similar user stories tasks or bugs Jira doesn't currently let you type two separate words as a label so if you do have to use two separate words then use an underscore or a dash between the two words so for our e-commerce shopping software application we'll label all user stories that are under our epics as follows for the epics for shopping cart canceling orders shopping interface and product search he'll use a label that's called shopping now everything that's tied to the management of the user Administration and the account handling side of things will label these issues as a user admin so that will be for all the issues that are underneath the two epics for user
account and loyalties program and lastly for any user story that's tied to displaying store information we'll label it as store info so let's hop back into Jira and I'll show you how to label these issues all right so now we're back into the backlog interface when you click on a user story for example this one the right panel will appear when we
scroll down to the details area you'll see a separate section called labels this is where you can type in your onew text to categorize your issue for this specific issue since it's underneath the parent epic for shopping cart let's call this label for shopping and then we'll select this so it's a new label so now that it's applied let's click return so now we can see that the shopping label has been applied to this specific user story let's click on the second user story in the backlog and let's go down to the label section right here when you click on the drop- down menu you'll see our newly created label for shopping appear right here so let's click it and then click outside of that area to finalize

our choice So Pro tip from me to quickly label an issue after you select it all you have to do is press the key keboard button for L and it will take you directly to the label ropdown and you'll be able to select the label for your issue so now with that said let's 
go ahead and let's label all the other issues underneath the epics for cancelling orders shopping interface and product search as shopping and as you go through this you'll start to see how easy it becomes once you start using the keyboard L shortcut button to quickly label your user stories so now we're going to repeat the labeling for shopping interface I'll use my keyboard shortcuts that way we can go through this very quickly and rinse and repeating that for the Epic for product search now let's label all issues  underneath the epics for user account and loyalties with a label of user admin you'll notice that I'm typing in the label with the hyphen in between them or a dash because you generally want to only use one word to characterize your label so I'll type in

user- admin and we'll repeat this for the remaining user stories that are underneath the Epic for user account and you'll find that it's really straightforward and easy to add in the labels once you've already set them up into your system let's do this again for the ones for the loyalties  program and lastly let's label all the issues underneath the Epic for shopping location with the label as store info all right so now we've labeled all of our user stories with the correct label with Jira we can quickly filter which issue is tied to the appropriate label by using this label filter that's at the top so an example here are all of the different issues that are associated with the label for shopping so everything that's tied to the Epic for shopping cart cancelling orders shopping interface and product search if we go back we can select only the issues tied to store info which is
for shopping location and then for user Administration we have all the user stories tied to user account and the loyalties program by the way as we move on to the next section make sure to smash that like button if for gaining any value out of this  tutorial all right so now we have our complete list of backlog items with user stories tasks and bugs tied to the appropriate labels and epics now Jira has two more tools that allow us
to prioritize and sort through all of our issues and they are what's called components and versions let's first talk about components if you open up the left side panel


you'll see a separate module for components if you click it you'll see here that it's completely empty at last thing it will tell you about the compass component section but they also have one that's specific to Jira components and you can see here that 
it's completely empty because we haven't created any components at this point in 
time as Jira says it right here components are subsections of a project and you want to use them to group issues within a project into smaller parts components are very similar to labels but to create them you do likely need to be an admin but since you created your project with your own Jira account you should have the ability to create components for your project as an example of how you would use components let's say that you're developing a software application you could have two separate components or the different platforms the app would Opera in for example iOS versus Android or Windows versus Mac OS and B B on the component type would mean that the issue will be assigned to the appropriate engineer to work on so similar to labels you can use
 filters based on the components and see the issues which are tied to that component so let's go ahead and create two components for our project first click on the create component button and you should see this dialogue box pop up for our first component let's call it iOS for description let's type in compatibility for iOS devices for component lead let's assign this to yourself so in my case I'll type in Alvin and then for default assigning let's select component lead and that way  it'll assign it to yourself click save and we'll now see that we've created our first component I'm going to ignore this popup for compus and instead we're going to focus only on the things tied to Jira 
components for now we have our first component so we have the component name component description who the component lead is the default assigning which in 
this case is the component lead for any issues that are associated with this component and then we have the number of issues tied to this component let's create our second component for Android by clicking on the create blue button on the top right side of your screen let's call the second component Android and for description 

let's type in compatibility for Android devices let's leave the other fields blank for now and let's click on Save let me show you how components can be assigned to issues so
let's go back to our backlog interface so we can see all the different issues inside of our backlog let's click on the first user story right here so it pops it open the details on the right hand side let's click on on the issue number so it pops open in its own separate tab
on the right hand side of the screen underneath the details area where there 
it says more Fields there should be a

separate section called components if you left click this box you're going to see a drop- down menu and you can choose appropriate component that is tied to this user story so for example of purposes let's assign this user story to the iOS component when we click out of it we'll see that this iOS component has been assigned to this user story so when you assign components to your other issues you'll be creating a hierarchical structure for your project that way it's easier to identify which user stories and tasks
are tied to iOS development or Android software development for example all right so let's go back to our component interface so when we click on comp components will be taken to this screen

when we click on the number of issues that are tied to the iOS component right here what we'll see is a different search area that's showing all the different issues that are tied to the component for iOS in our case it will only show us the one issue that we just assigned to it so this is very helpful if you have a lot of user stories tied to the development of different software platforms that you need to manage and sort through and for now let's go back to our main project and let's talk about how we can use versions to track the releases of specific features of our software app project on the left hand side of the panel there is a releases interface module here so click it and
you should now see this screen as Jira says it right here versions help you package and schedule project deliveries as a release of your work for software projects your releases will usually be something like release 1.0 1.1 2.0 and so on so let's create a version by
clicking on the create version button for our first version of the software that we're developing let's call it version one for our start date let's say that we're starting on January 15 2024

and that our plan release date is about 6 months from now by n of Q2 2024 so that would let's say June 28th of this year for description let's say that the purpose of this initial release is to allow customers to buy products online let's click save and we'll see right away that we now have a version one populated in this table the status of course is still unreleased no issues have been linked to version one yet and so the progress is no issues and to the right of these s we see our planed start date and our planed release date for releasing this software version to our customers and finally we see the overall description of the purpose of this software version now let's go back to
our backlog interface so we can see how versions can be linked to our issues whether it's a user story a task or a bug on the top bar menu right here you'll see a drop- down menu for versions click on it it and then select version similar to how our epic panel is
versions also have a separate panel that way it's easier to access and see which issues are linked to the appropriate software release Pro tip from me if you press the keyboard button for V it will expand or collapse the left panel for versions that way it's much easier to access so let's close out the epics panel and let's focus only on versions
for now now if you click on the Arrow next to version 1.0 you'll see all the details that are tied to this software release we see it General description that we just defined earlier as well as a number of issues that have been assigned to it and those that have been completed we also see the plan start and plan release date for this version now
to link our issues to version 1.0 all

you have to do is drag and drop our user stories on on top of it so let's drag and drop our first user story onto version one and you'll see that the user story has now been labeled as version one so let's go ahead and let's add all the issues under the Epic for shopping cart cancelling orders and shopping interface to version one pro tip from me you can quickly select multiple issues and drag and drop them onto the version so it
classifies them much faster let's rinse and repeat that for the Epic for counseling orders and let's tie that to version one let's also tie the version one to the Epic for shopping
interface all right so now we've added in these version one releases to the Epic for shopping cart cancelling order and shopping interface now let's say that we want the issues underneath the epics for user account and product search to be underneath the next software release for version 2.0 so to create the next version click on the
plus create version button in the left panel let's call our version version 2.0 and let's put in here for the plan start date let's say that it's going to be July 88th

and then for the plan release date let's say that it's going to be September 30 let's leave the driver to be me still and for description let's say that this is the Beta release for user accounts and product searches and then we'll click on save all right so now let's go in and drag and drop the user stories underneath the epics of user account and product search into the second version to make this fast let's left click the check mark box for each of these ones under the Epic for user account and let's drag and drop this
underneath version 2.0 and then we'll see version 2.0 labeled and categorized for these user stories and then let's rinse and repeat this for the Epic for product search all right so now we've labeled those two Epic with version 2.0 and all that's remaining is now the next version for version 3.0 all right so now let's create version 3.0 which will store the remaining user stories and bugs let's call it version3 and let's have it have a start date at the beginning of October with a planned release date by  the end of December of 2024 and for description let's call it added loyalties program and shopping location interface let's now go ahead and assign the remaining issues to version

3.0 and then for the other bugs that we have here let's add that into the software version for 1.0 now we've assigned all user stories to the appropriate software version release so when you click version one for example example you'll only see the issues that are applicable for that software release so this feature of Jira and being able to filter based upon the version release itself is extremely helpful to prioritize and see which work items will be prioritized on its upcoming software release for its General product road map and you can see the general overview of all the releases when you click on the releases interface right here so when you expand it out you can see everything that we created previously so version 3 version 2.0 and version one if let's say that all of the user stories underneath release version one is ready for release then all you have to do is go all the way to the right hand side click on the three dots

icon and then select release now for the purposes of this  tutorial we won't be releasing anything at this point in time so we can move on and talk about

managing our backlog and doing what's called backlog grooming all right so one 
of the most important aspects of leading agile projects is prioritizing your team's work based on which features bring the most value to the customers in other words what features must they have so the product can be used and with agile it's very important to prioritize and rank your issues against each other so it's clear what work needs to happen in the upcoming Sprint and typically the one responsible for doing this will be
the product owner the product manager and in some instances depending on the
company and how your roles expectations are set up the agile project manager or 
scrum Master those two may help out as well and facilitate those discussions so going back to Jira here you put your full list of work inside of this entire backlog and Jira allows us to drag and drop each issue whether it's a user story or a bug into the appropriate order and in doing that we're changing the priority of each issue so for

example if I drag and drop the third user story above the second one then that means that it has a higher priority than the one we pushed right below it this is a very simple concept to understand but it's actually harder to understand an Implement in real life
especially if you have a long list of more than 20 to 50 items that you need to rank and prioritize all at once and it can feel extremely overwhelming so let me share with you my own tips with how you can prioritize and groom your product backlog all right now since we've already classified our work based on the software versions that will be
releasing let's toggle the versions panel by pressing the keyboard button for V that way it expands and we will only select version one for now that way we only focus on the items of work that need to be released as soon as possible for the first initial software release and as you can see the number of issues that we have to prioritize has gone down by more than half which makes it less overwhelming for us so instead of
originally 44 issues we now just have to prioritize 16 issues since versions two and version three won't be released anytime soon we can focus our efforts only on versions one features which must be released in the next few months so let's take a look and let's go through all the items in our backlog for version 1.0 the first user story is for checking out items from the shopping cart since it's very important for customers to be
able to place items for purchasing let's leave this as a number one priority for now let's go down to the second user story and we see here that this one is to review the items in the shopping cart let's keep this as a lower priority than the first one I want you to note here that as we're going through the backlog\

you'll see that I only prioritize issues going upward and not downward meaning I focus on sending items up the top portion of the backlog and not downward I like to review each issue line by line and compare it to the ones above it if the issue is not that important then I do not send it to the bottom of the backlog I like to leave it as is and I go on to the next issue until I find one that has a higher priority and from my own experience this makes grooming the backlog a much more easier and simplified process so you only have to go through the backlog one time instead of having to repeat and go through it multiple multiple times the third user story for updating the number of items in the shopping cart does not have a higher priority so let's leave it as is and let's go to the next one now we can see here that the next two user stories are about customizing the customer's shipping address for our example let's say that these two user stories are higher priority than being able to update the items in the shopping cart so let's left click click the check mark box to the side of these issues and let's drag and drop them above the user story for updating the number of items

in the shopping cart when we let go it automatically ranks it higher than the story for updating the items in the shopping cart let's now move on to the next issue which is the user story for adding in credit card information since this involves allowing a customer to pay for their purchase let's say that this user story has a higher priority than the one above it so let's left click it and drag and drop it above that line item now the next user stories are tied to cancelling orders which do not have a higher priority than the ones for the user stories underneath the Epic for shopping cart so let's leave these as is for now the next user story is for viewing products available in the store and this has a higher priority than the user stories for cancelling orders so let's drag these above these two in terms of ranking and priority now we have the next user story which is for choosing the size and quantities for the items that the customer wants now this user story has a higher priority than the user story for updating the items in the cart so let's drag and drop it above these ones this us story also has a higher priority than adding in the credit card information or customizing the shipping address so let's drag and drop it above those in terms of priority all right now going back to this user story 

which is I want to view products available in the store this one well customers must be 
able to view products that are available in the store before they can actually make a purchase so this story would technically have a number one priority so let's drag and drop it above the first user story for checking out items in the shopping cart all right now we have the next two user stories for viewing the sales price of similar items in the catalog this one seems like it would have a higher priority because it's tied to viewing the products in the store so that they can make a purchase so let's make this a higher priority than being able to customize your shipping address and possibly even reviewing the items in the cart so let's make it a number three priority in terms of the backlog so now the top three items in the backlog are viewing products available in the store I want to check out items from my shopping cart and viewing sales price of similar items in the catalog for purchase now for the remaining issues that are inside our backlog these have not yet been prioritized for the first bug this is an error when the user tries to check out with the shopping cart since this is tied to being able to check out items from my shopping cart let's drag and drop this below the priority of the checking out items user story in terms of priority that way it at least gets prioritized in the top three for the next one we have search results do not appear when using the Android mobile

app for this one since this is more tied to searching let's leave it as is and actually let's drag and drop this so that way we can move it to a higher priority so it's right below the the first error message and for the other bug for Windows do not resize when the app begins loading since this is a lower severe bug and defect let's leave it as 
is and for the final bug where the

incorrect amount of bills and expenses adds up during checkout this seems like a very critical issue that does need to be resolved so let's drag and drop into a higher priority right below being able to ensure that search results do appear so now we have reprioritized all the items in our backlog the first five are viewing products available in the store checking out items from the shopping cart fixing the different bugs tied to checking out the cart fixing search results and fixing the correct amounts of bills and expenses when you're checking out items that are more than five quantities so now we've groom the entire backlog for all of the features that must be developed for the first release of our software again this is just an example to show you how to groom
your backlog and how to prioritize and

rank each user story using Jira now before we can set up our Sprints we need to make sure that everything inside our backlog is set up correctly first is every issue assigned to an epic so to do that pull up your backlog and let's open up the Epic panel left click and choose the option for issues without epics for any issues which do not have an assigned 
epic we want to assign them appropriately epics are very important because they make sure that all of our user stories and tasks especially bugs are aligned to the features and the goals of the product that we're developing so in this case we forgot to assign these bugs to the correct epics so let's go through this line by line error message when user tries to check out with shopping cart this is tied to shopping cart so let's drag and drop it right here the second one is tied to search results so let's tie it to product search the next bug is tied to shopping cart for incorrect amounts so again that's tied to shopping cart and then this one is more of Windows does not resize when the app begins loading

this one is more of a shopping interface so let's drag and drop it here all right so everything looks good and we have now assigned all the issues to the appropriate epics as we can see see on the screen right here now the next thing to do is to make sure that our backlog items are assigned with the correct version so let's pull up the version panel by pressing the V keyboard shortcut or by left clicking on the version menu right here now let's click on the button for issues without versions and we can see that we have a handful of issues that are not tied to a specific software release it's important to assign these correctly ly so it's clear when we plan to release certain features so let's go ahead and assign all these issues to version one to do that we'll bulk select all of these issues by pressing the shift button and then we'll drag and drop them onto version one all right so now that we've done that this will automatically correct itself and there are no issues that have been labeled without the correct version so if we click on version one everything is correctly labeled as version one as we can see right here and if you deselect version one as you scroll through it all issues and user stories have been labeled with the correct version and version one consists of all the user stories tasks

and bugs that need to be worked on as soon as possible for our very first software release all the other versions are a much lower priority since these will not be released until later on in the year all right so now that we've groomed our entire backlog and we
prioritized the issues for our first release let's set up the very first Sprint for our project now before we do that don't forget to smash that like button so I know you like and appreciate my content now Jira already pre-re your Sprint for you when you initially set up our project but let's say that you don't have your Sprint already created so let me show you how to create your Sprint so I I've deleted it already and to create your Sprint all you have to do is click on the button that says create Sprint and when you do that you'll see a new drop- down section appear for the first Sprint which is called Esa Sprint

one and in the middle area right here is where we can drag and drop the different user stories that we want our team to work on for the current Sprint and so when you're using the scrum framework as a scrum master or agile project manager during your Sprint planning meeting you're going to work with a product owner and your team to identify which issues are the ones that your team can realistically complete based on the required effort using an estimate that's known as story points now when we look

at the issues inside the backlog you'll notice that there are these gray circles with a line through them this is where you assign store story points to each user story in other words what is the amount of effort that your team thinks is required to complete it and to assign user stories it's typical for teams to pull numbers from a modified version of
the Fibonacci sequence from the following 1 2 3 5 8 and 13 and I'll show a matrix table on the screen right here that way you can have it for your reference so it's clear what story Point corresponds to the amount of effort time and task complexity for our example let's go through the first several user stories and assign story points to them 
again in real life projects you want to work with your team to provide you with these story Point estimates for our first user story of viewing products in the store let's say that this will take a moderate amount of effort and likely a few days of time so let's assign it a user story point value of five and then we'll click the check mark box that appears andol uh we're again we're doing this based on the Matrix table that I'm showing on the screen right here for our second user story of checking out items

from the shopping cart let's say that this requires a severe amount of effort and it will take roughly at least a week due to the medium complexity of work involved so let's assign a story point value of N8 so for today's purpose of this tutorial we're only going to be assigning story points to the user stories so we're going to skip over the bugs for now the next user story is for viewing the sales price of similar items in the catalog so as you can see as we've started assigning story points to each user story we can see that this number has already started pre-populating and summing up the number 
of story points that are user stories have been assigned to so in this case we have a total story Point number of 13 let's skip over our bugs for now and let's move on to our next two user stories for these two let's assign both of them story Point values of five and for our fifth user story 


let's assign it a value of eight story points and for our sixth user story let's assign in a value of three story points and right away we can see that we've already estimated a total of 34 story points now let's say that your team agrees that this amount of work that we've already calculated here is the total amount of work that the team can commit to completing for the current upcoming Sprint in the next two weeks so to assign these issues to the current Sprint all you have to do is left click the check mark box to the left of the user stories and pressing shift all the way down to the last user story so now we've selected the user stories plus the bugs and then let's drag and drop them into the current Sprint and voila we have all user stories and bugs with a total of 34 story points assigned to the current Sprint number one again these user stories have not yet been assigned to a team member since this is just a sample project for playing with so you can get familiar with how to use Jira let's assign all of these different user stories and bugs to yourself which in this example would be my name AKA Alvin and in real life projects you would actually assign different user

stories to multiple people so that each person is not overloaded beyond their work capacity so on the right hand side with a person icon you'll do what I just did and will assign it to the appropriate person so now all user stories for the upcoming Sprint  number one have been assigned to the correct person and they've kept their  prioritization from when we prioritized and groomed the backlog so to start the Sprint all you have to do is click on the blue button that says start Sprint and then we'll see this window pop up for the Sprint name let's leave the Sprint name as Esa Sprint one and for duration in real life projects I like to usually set this to be 2 weeks but for the purposes of this  tutorial tutorial let's do a custom duration for start date I'll put today's date which is January 1 New Year right and then for the end date we're going to put jary one as well and so that I can show you everything for using Sprints 


I'm going to have this finished in the next 45 minutes so that should be roughly by 4:30 p.m. that way I can walk you through what the Sprint will look like when it's completed and I can demonstrate how it works for the Sprint goal let's say that the goal is to create the checking out functionality in the software app now let's click the blue button for start and when we do that Jira automatically takes us to the Sprint conon board and has already populated it with all the user stories assigned to the to-do column so all the user stories as well as the different tasks that are tied to this user story and if I Collapse it you can see everything that has already been created inside of here we see here also that the subt for the first user story are shown below it with the remaining user stories occupying their own visual card now if we click a card for the first user story or the subtask it'll pop open on the right hand side so we can see all of the details unfortunately this is a simple board with only three columns for Todo in progress and done and in real life projects you might need to customize it to suit the needs of your te team and

the best practices for your organization's approach so to keep this  tutorial tutorial a little bit more simplified we're going to be focusing only on the user stories and subtask that we've put inside of our Sprint so to customize our scrum board to suit the needs of your team or let's say your organization all you need to do is click on the three dots button right here at the top right corner and then select configure board after you wait for a little bit it's it's going to pop open the settings for the esa board now we want to go to the settings for columns we can see here the three different columns that Jira has already created for us for our workflow we have too in progress and done for our workflow let's create another column called to verify so let's click on the plus symbol right here and let's call this new column to verify we'll leave category as is for now and we'll click on ADD column so now we have our updated status and updated columns so we have to do in progress to verify and done so if we go back to our project to our scrum board this is what we're going to see we're going to see the updated columns that we just implemented with to verify right between in progress and done now during your Sprint when you're reviewing your team's progress on their completed task and user stories all all you have to do is drag and drop the subtask or the user story Into the appropriate column so as an example let's drag and drop this subtask called right acceptance test and review Into the column for in progress

and you'll see that it now has moved and the number here for in progress has now changed to three and then of course the goal is to move all items from too all the way to done so let's go ahead and move these three subtasks all the way to done so you can see what that looks like and you can see that once it hits done a green box appears right around it to Showcase that it's been completed and the key ID number for that issue has been crossed out showing that it has been completed now 

let's say that we finished all subtasks for the first user story so let's drag and drop all of them 
across the different Columns of this scrum board and then we'll do our best to put them under underne the done column and when you do that you're going to see that this new window appears all subtests for parent issue are now complete do you want to update this parent issue to match so let's click undone and let's click update to reflect
that accordingly to have your board reflect that this user story has now been completed click the refresh button for your window and 



it should change to reflect done so now this user story has been marked completed collapsing this user story we now have the other user stories that we do need to complete for this Sprint so let's go ahead and let's drag and drop a few of the other user stories into the next two columns to Showcase their progress for our team's work and we'll put a few on to verify and 

a few in progress and voila we've completed two user stories in done we have one in the status of to verify one in progress and one that's still to do as we're doing this you'll also notice that the number of issues that shown next to each status column also changes to reflect this progress Pro tip usually in real life projects as you update each user story you want to input a comment into each user story as I'm showing on the screen all right so in this comment I put in work has started and coding has developed of of course this comment will

be dependent upon what your team member actually does they may even go in themselves to input the update but at least this shows you the idea that you can input comments to reflect the latest progress on different subtasks and user stories by the way in the top right portion of the Sprint you'll see a clock showing how much time is left before your Sprint is over this is just a neat feature that Jira has so you'll have it in mind as you're reviewing your team's work now that we've gone through the the different user stories for this Sprint and we've pushed them from Todo to done let's close out this Sprint by clicking on the complete Sprint Blue Button we'll now see this new dialogue window pop open we have the opportunity to select where we want our unresolved open issues to be moved into whether it's a new Sprint or to the backlog it's also kind of cool because it tells us how many issues have been completed and how many issues are still open in our case we have two open unresolved issues as best

practice I like to have my unfinished user stories moved back to the backlog so that they can be re-evaluated by the product owner and the team for what the priorities should be so let's select the backlog for now and then click complete Sprint all right so now Jira has updated it and right now we've been taking out side of our combine board View and we're back into our backlog in the versions panel to the right we now see a progress bar of how many user stories have been marked done and how many are still in progress so four out of 16 are done and

one out of 16 are in progress and at the end of every Sprint you'll also gain access to different reports to do that click on the reports menu on the left side panel you can review different kinds of reports such as the burn up the burn down chart as well as the Sprint chart so let me show you real quickly what that looks like so this is the burnd down chart again this will not be what it would actually look like since we did finish it very quickly this would then be the burnup chart and then this is then the Sprint report so for the scope of this  tutorial tutorial let's go through the Sprint report here we have 
an overview of our burndown chart and at the bottom we have a status report of how many issues our team completed and 

the issues which were not completed for our burndown chart this is just an example of what you might see as a disclaimer the chart that I'm showing you right now would not be representative of what you would actually see for your real life projects since we did try to finish everything in less than 30 minutes 

as a disclaimer this is just a demonstration so you could see what it's like to move different user stories and items from the different columns all the way to done and at the bottom this is your status report where you can review your data with your team and discuss what happened and what was a road block that prevented us from completing these remaining user stories and in so doing you're planning ahead for how your team can perform better for the next upcoming Sprint in other words what can we do in the next Sprint to prevent this from happening now if you have too many issues that are showing not completed then it's likely that your team was too optimistic and they overestimated how much effort it would take to actually complete the work all right so if you stuck with me this far you have now mastered how to use Jira for beginners
