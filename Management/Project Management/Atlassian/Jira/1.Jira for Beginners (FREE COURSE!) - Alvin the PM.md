#### Jira for Beginners
We'll go through everything you need to know so you can use Jira the fast way.
We're first going to do a refresher on 
- agile Concepts and 
- Jira terms and then we'll dive into the 
- Jira interface 
-- creating your very first project and 
-- setting up Jira issues 
-- user stories and 
-- bugs 
and then we're going to 
- set up your projects labels 
- components and 
- versions 
and finally 
- how to groom and 
- prioritize it items in your backlog and 
- set up your very first Sprint 

so if you're a complete beginner and you have never used Jira before then watch this  tutorial from beginning to the end.

to follow along with this tutorial I created my free guide with how to use Jira and it contains all the data that we're going to use to create our project in this Jira.

Questions:
1) what is your biggest struggle with Jira and 
2) what questions do you have about using Jira to manage your agile projects

**==Jira is one of the most popular software tools used to manage agile projects==**. **but before we can start using Jira you must understand how agile works.** because Jira assumes that you already know it.
Specifically with a two popular methodologies of **SCRUM** and **KANBAN**, not a deep dive into agile but quick refresher so you can start using Jira the fast way.

#### Agile Concepts:

**What is Agile?**
Agile is a methodology that uses an iterative approach to develop a product 
building and releasing it incrementally,
instead of trying to deliver everything to the customer at the very end of a project 
like you would a traditional waterfall approach 

Agile promotes early delivery and focuses on adapting to changing requirements as you obtain customer feedback during every single iteration,
underneath the agile umbrella are two popular methodologies we have 
- scrum 
- Kanban
these both have different workflows and templates that exist inside of Jira.

there is one difference and that has to do with a box period of time as known as a 
- Sprints are used here to develop the product in the scrum framework while
- Kanban does not use Sprints 

==**What is sprint?**
a Sprint is an amount of time that the team commits to completing their work and delivering a working product by the end of it. ==
eg:  let's say that we Define our Sprint to be weeks - Two weeks sprint. 
At the beginning of the Sprint, the team holds what's called a **Sprint planning meeting**, where the entire team discusses and agrees upon what are all the work can be completed in the next two weeks.

the team also discusses 
- how much effort it's going to take to complete these **Items** and 
- they put these items into what's called a **Sprint backlog** 
Sprint Backlog?
-- is a prioritized list of items for the team to work on for the next 2 weeks and every single day during your Sprint the team holds a **daily scrum** or **a quick 15minute meeting** to review the team's **Review Progress** and **Roadblocks** on their assigned items in the Sprint backlog and  

at the very end of the Sprint, the team presents the developed product to the product owner or the customer for their review and their feedback 

##### Scrum:
Let's go through a high level example of a Sprint workflow using's JIRA's Scrum Sprint Template,
this is a scrum board inside of Jira broken up into four columns,
- To-do 
- In-progress
- Testing
- Done
eg: In our to-do column, we have three tasks that the team needs to complete during the Sprint,
Todo: (Tasks)
 1: code the user interface 
 2: fix a bug that's related to the payment screen and 
 3: create the database schema 
**the goal of the Sprint is to take all items through each column until they reach the done column and by the end of the two weeks were we able to complete all the items on our scrum board**. 
and if not what Roadblocks we have during the Sprint that prevented us from actually doing that.

Now this scrum board can look different for every team and some teams. They may actually want to have more statuses or different columns than the default. In general, this is a very high level overview with scrum. 

##### Kanban:
Now, some teams prefer to use the Kanban approach. Because, they don't work best within a time box period of time for let's say 2 weeks. For such instance with Kanban workflow, you'll be using a similar board like the one I'm showing from earlier for scrum where the goal is to do everything you can to push all items from **todo** list to **done**. Now, instead of planning work in a time box iteration,

Kanban uses what's called a **PULL SYSTEM** to simply just move those cards throughout process each time the team completes an item of work. 
it triggers a pull to bring in the next item that they're going to work on.
Since there will usually be what's called a **work in progress** or **whip** limit for each column on the combine board whenever there's an empty slot on the board.

**that's a signal for the team to pull work from the previous columns as long as there are items available.** so in general for Kanban, work is continuously being pulled from the left to the right side of the board. 

###### Scrum - Projects > Epics + User Stories:
So with the scrum methodology, it breaks down a project into smaller bits of user functionality which are known as epics and user stories.

and these will be the most common types that you're going to create for your projects inside of Jira.

==**What is Epic?**
 Epic is a large body of work that cannot be completed inside of one Sprint== and 
 usually your team will break this epic up into multiple users user stories 

==**What is a User Story?**
 a user story is a story represents a feature or a capability that needs to be created. a brief sentence that describes the desired capability of the product from the perspective of the end user hence the name user story.==  
 A User story format is as a user type, I want some capability so that a benefit can be achieved. when all user stories are completed underneath an epic then the Epic itself is completed.

Eg: if you're building a shopping software app, then the 
Jira project: shopping software application, underneath that we could have an epic for the shopping cart interface and one of the user stories within that epic would be as a customer I want to check out items for my shopping cart so that I can purchase my items now in this example the role is from the perspective of the customer the desired capability is to check out items

from your shopping cart and the benefit is to purchase the items so in Jira you're going to have multiple user stories linked underneath one Epic as I'm showing in this example on the screen right here so here our epic is shopping interface functionality and

I've listed a few examples of user stories that are associated with this epic some of these user stories might be completed in one Sprint so in general this is how the agile methodology breaks down a project into smaller pieces of work that can be done over iterations by the way if you're ging any value out of this  tutorial don't forget to subscribe to the channel for more  tutorials like this and to smash that like button now let's talk about how Jira Works 

after you sign up with a free Jira account using my link in the description bar down below atlastin will ask you to create a website which is what will store all of
your projects within your organization Jira operates with the following hierarchical structure at the very top is your Jira account instance which is the website name you created when you initially signed up to alassian underneath this are the different projects which are associated with the different products software applications or services that your team is developing to set up your projects and everything that's inside of Jira 

you create what are known as issues which are just work items or tickets that require an action from a person every ticket that you create in Jira is known as an issue and Jira has four issue categories as follows underneath a project are your
epics and as we've discussed earlier an epic is the largest chunk of work that you can have and they're used to categorize your work so think of an epic as the highle features of your product for example user account management shopping interface module or product search optimization epics they help us align the product that we're creating to certain features and product goals epics typically span several weeks to complete and they should be a large piece of work it should not be something that can be done in 1 to three days now underneath her epic Jira has three other issue types that you can create the first is a story what's also known as a user story which we reviewed earlier and they represent few functionality to be built for your product the second is called a bug or a defect that was discovered in a previously completed user story that was thought to be quote unquote done and the next type we have is a task or work that's required to get an item to be done and at the lowest level of this hierarchy you have a subtask subtasks are found underneath a story and ideally should be completed in one day or less so that the team thinks carefully about what work actually needs to be done 

so,  as an example when you're logged into your Jira account for your sample project if you click on the blue create button at the Middle top portion of your screen you're going to see that you can create four of these issue types a task a story a bug or an epic and we're going to go through this in much more detail later in this  tutorial so make sure to watch this entire tutorial so now that you understand how Jira is set up I want you to sign up and create a free account with the Jira software using my link down below that way you can follow along step by step so we can create an agile project from beginning to the end 

so pause the  tutorial and sign up using my link down below and once you've created your account return back to this  tutorial so let's hop inside my computer so
you can follow along with me all right so now that we're inside Jira you should see the following interface at the time of this recording every year alasan does make some minor improvements and updates to the software so some things might look different and they may change in the future but overall just remember
that the overall functionality should not change at least from the users

standpoint so to match exactly what I'm seeing click on the Jos software logo at the top left of your screen and this should take you to a page designated for your work think of the Jira software button at the top left as your homepage screen so you can see quick links to all of your recent projects here we can see our newly created recent project called my scrum project and if you move your mouse to the very bottom you can see that we have zero open issues if you click on the drop- down menu for the board you'll see that we have one scrum board created for this project underneath this section are the quick links to the different items that we've worked on so boards projects issues and any items that have been assigned me and lastly any projects boards filters or dashboards that we've starred for quick access so think of this start tab kind of like your favorites tab of your internet browser except it's for Jira so anytime you click on the star icon next

to a filter or a project it's going to appear in this list now Pro tip for me if you're working on several projects at once I recommend starring them so they show up right here and it's going going to help speed up tremendously your workflow and productivity right now this won't show anything because we haven't created anything at this point in time now before we create our project in Jira don't forget to smash that like button to show me your support and so I can keep creating high quality content like this now since we're inside of Jira I want us to create our very first project for developing an Ecommerce shopping software application as a disclaimer it's very important that you create your own free jur account that's separate from the company that you work for so that you'll have your own admin access to create projects and you'll have much more leeway with what you can do and you'll have a lot more privileges with how you can set things up inside of Jira so if you're using your company's Jira account I encourage you to log out and set up your own free Jer account using my link down below so with that said a product is any app product or service

you're developing for our example our project will follow the scrum approach to develop an eCommerce shopping software app now let's take a closer look inside so inside of Jira to create a project move your mouse to the projects tab at the top of your screen and left click it in the new popup menu click on the button on the very bottom of the menu called create project at last will now ask you to use a specific template to create your project and on

the left hand side are different templates that we can use such as software development service management for it work management for tracking tasks marketing product management human resources and the list just goes on the templates that you use will be preset and customize how your workflow will appear inside of Jira so let's go back to the templates for software development two of the most common ones are  Kanban or scrum  Kanban where you can track your work using a simple board and you can limit the work of progress and

if we go back and we choose the scrum template then we can plan our upcoming work inside of a backlog and we can organize our cycles of work into what's known as Sprints so for our project example let's click on the button for use template for using scrum now what we'll see is we have to choose the project type is it going to be a team managed project or will it be a company manage project so the team manage project will only have the essential features it'll have a much

more simplified configuration and it

will be more limiting so to give us the

most flexibility with our configuration

and so we can set up everything

ourselves let's choose the company

manage project and we'll click on the

bottom the blue button at the very

bottom of the

screen now we're at this screen where we

have to input our project details so for

every project that you have to create

you need to set up is Project name and

its unique key so that it can be easily

referenced throughout Jira for our

project name let's call it e-commerce

shopping

app so the project key consists of a few

letters that you'll be seeing whenever

you're working throughout Jira it can be

anything but usually you want to name

your key a few letters so it's easy to

track and remember your issues within

your project for our example let's name

our key

Esa that way it's really easy to

remember and see throughout your Jira

project now let's click on the next

button so so far we've added our project

name our project key we've selected the

template for scrum and we've chosen the

company managed project type so now

let's click on the next button all right

so now that we've clicked the next

button we have officially created our

scrum project for our software app

inside of Jira now the first screen that

we're seeing right here is for the

active Sprints which we'll call as the

scrum board Jira calls it the esa board

that's named based upon our project key

for Esa or our e-commerce shopping app

in the scrum board Jira already creates

your board with three columns from too

in progress and done and when we set up

our Sprints we'll see our user stories

task and bugs that we need to complete

for the Sprint populated within these

three columns and the goal here is to

get all user stories all the way to the

done column we can transition any item

from one status to the next so for

example from to do and then moving it to

in progress and finally to done and I'll

show you later in this  tutorial that you

can also customize this scrum board so

it shows different columns other than to

do in progress and done so at this point

in time we're not seeing any information

populated inside of our scrum board and

that's just because we haven't created

any data yet but not only that our

Sprint has not yet started now on the

left hand side of the screen is a panel

which has different views for your

project Pro tip from me you can easily

collapse or expand this left panel by

either pressing this left Arrow key

right here and then repressing again to

expand it or you can do an alternate

keyboard shortcut by pressing the left

bracket on your keyboard so when you

press it once the left panel will

disappear and go away press the left

bracket again and it will reappear

so I like to use this shortcut to

maximize my viewing window when I'm

reviewing my projects and just make it

so much more efficient now above active

Sprints we have the backlog interface

which is where we'll be adding in and

creating all of our issues for our epics

user stories tasks and bugs this entire

backlog in this section right here this

is what the product owner or the product

manager will be managing and grooming

now let's say if your role is as an

agile project manager or a scrum master

or a developer on your scrum team then

this backlog is how you're going to see

work that's coming up in terms of

priorities now the backlog screen as

well as the active Sprints are the two

modules that you'll be primarily using

whenever you're using Jira all right so

let's say you're in the scrum board

interface here Pro tip from me if you

press the number key one you will switch

directly to the backlog module and let's

say your mouse has not selected anything

if you press the number key for two

you're going to switch to the active

scrum Sprint board as I'm showing on the

screen so just pressing the number key

one or the number key two to switch back

and forth between the backlog and the

Sprint scrum board these are super

helpful keyboard shortcuts that I use

all the time time whenever I'm

navigating and using Jira so for our

e-commerce shopping software app the

goal is to develop a software that

allows customers to search for and buy

products from the physical retail store

using their phone so we're going to have

seven epics as part of building this

software app we'll have the shopping

cart cancelling orders user accounts

shopping interface product search

loyalties program and shopping location

and underneath these different epics

we're going to have different user

stories and some tasks and separate from

this we're going to also add a few bugs

into our J Project so we can see how

bugs and errors in the software can be

added into a Sprint for tracking and

resolution purposes so you can follow

along with this tutorial you can access

all of the sample data that we'll be

using inside my free Jira guide download

it at alvan theep

pm.com slf free guide all right so let's

create our first epic called shopping

cart and then we'll add our user stories

and tasks to it later to do that let's

navigate to our backlog module by

clicking on it or pressing the keyboard

shortcut for one to create our epic we

have to create an issue for our project

so click on the blue create button

that's at the very top portion of your

screen screen and it's going to open up

this dialogue

box I like to expand it that way you can

see the full view right

here and what you're going to see is

you're going to have to fill out all the

different details for this issue just

remember that all issues must belong

inside of a project so you can see we

have our project selected for the

e-commerce shopping

app for the issue we can see that we

have four available typ to us a task a

story a bug or an epic so let's choose

an epic for now moving on the status

let's leave it as too for now for the

Epic name so it's easy for us to

identified in Jira let's call it

shopping

cart and for the summary name let's also

call it shopping

cart I recommend keeping your summary

short and concise because this summary

is what you're going to see within your

backlog the next drop- down menu is to

define the parent since this is the Epic

itself there will not be a parent above

it but when we create our user stories

and our tasks later on that's when we'll

put this underneath the parent for the

Epic so for now let's leave this as

blank now we have the components which

we'll cover later in this  tutorial now for

description this is where we can add

some detail about the Epic let's say

that this is for defining the

functionality for the shopping cart

interface for checking out and

purchasing

items all right so what's great about

the description interface is that you

can format your text as you want so you

can bold you can italicize and you can

even color the words for the description

inside this text box it's extremely

userfriendly and very easy to use

underneath that section is the reporter

which in this case is the person who is

creating this issue which in our case is

me so Alvin there is a drop- down field

here for defining its priority so we

have medium highest high low and lowest

I'm going to leave it for now as medium

and we'll use a priority drop down more

in depth when we create our user stories

and tasks labels here are a way for us

to categorize your issues so it's easy

to filter and search for specific user

stories for now let's leave this as

blank and then we have linked issues

meaning if your issue is connected to or

dependent upon another issue for assign

let's leave this as automatic for now

but for future issues we're going to

have to make sure that you assign this

to yourself or whoever is going to be

assigned to that issue and lastly we'll

leave Sprint blank for now since we

haven't yet defined the Sprint and then

we can click the blue create button at

the very

bottom now once we do that we're going

to see a popup at the bottom left of the

screen saying that we have created Esa

one issue which is the Epic that we just

created so let's click on this x right

here to exit the popup we'll notice

though is that in the backlog screen the

epics do not immediately appear and

that's because they reside within the

epics panel so to open up your epics

panel what you're going to have to do is

click on the Epic dropdown menu that I'm

showing right here this is at the very

top portion of your screen so click on

the Epic drop-down menu and click on

Epic now what you're going to see is the

Epic panel appear towards the left hand

side of your screen to maximize the

viewing space let's collapse the left

side panel for now by either pressing

the top left Arrow key or by pressing

the bracket keyboard shortcut Pro tip

from me you can easily open up the epics

panel by pressing the E keyboard

shortcut so type in E once and it's

going to be collapsed Type e again and

then the epics panel will appear again

to your left hand side and it's like

this because epics are separate and

they're one level above your user

stories your tasks and your bugs so so

right now we have our shopping cart epic

shown on the left panel let's add

another epic by clicking on the plus

sign create epic underneath it for our

second epic let's create one for

cancelling orders and we'll type that

into the Epic name and

summary all right so now we've created

two epics for our project let's go ahead

and let's create the remaining five

epics first is for the user account epic

all all right so for the first epic that

we'll create let's call it user account

epic let's copy and paste into the

summary and at the very bottom of the

screen there's a check mark for create

another issue let's make sure that's

actually check marked so that way it

speeds up the process for creating our

epics and our future issues click on

Create and then you'll see a

notification at the very bottom that one

issue was created let's do another epic

for shopping interface

when you do that make sure that you

update the summary and the Epic name so

they're both updated so we can see that

the Epic name and summary has been

updated to reflect shopping interface

and then we'll click on create again

it'll show that two issues have now been

created so let's repeat this again for

creating the Epic for product search in

both the Epic name and

summary let's click on

Create and each time you'll see that the

number at the bottom also increases as

well so at this point we have now

created three issues or three epics for

our project now let's create our next

epic for the loyalties

program let's click

create and then let's type in the next

epic for shopping

location we're making sure that we're

typing in shopping location both into

the Epic name and

summary let's click create and then

we'll see that we've now cre created

Five epics or five issues for our

project let's click on the x button at

the very

top let's click discard issue and now we

can see that we have populated these

issues within our project so we have

shopping cart cancelling orders user

account shopping interface product

search loyalties program and shopping

location let's take a closer look at one

of these so let's click on the arrow

that that's next to shopping cart what

you'll see is underneath it we see the

key for the Epic we also see how many

issues are associated with this epic we

also see how many have been completed as

well as an estimate of the number of

story points that are required to

complete this epic let's click on view

details and what we're going to have is

a separate panel open up on the right

hand side and this will show all the

details that we've entered in so far for

this epic in the top row of icons we can

attach a file to this epic we can add a

child issue underneath this epic or we

can link an issue underneath it or

another website or page or even

Confluence and right below it we have

the status of this epic and right now

it's showing that we're in too and then

we have the description box right below

it which is what we type in earlier and

right below it are the different details

tied to this epic so we have who the

person is assigned to the reporter or

the person who created it we also have

labels and its priority there are other

fields below this as well so we have

story points original estimate time

tracking components Sprint and fix

versions all issues whether it's a story

a task or a bug will have similar feel

this for an epic so just something to

keep in mind Pro tip from me there is a

color box icon that's next to the Epic

name I encourage you to color code your

epics so that it's easier for you to

visually identify your epics and group

them together so let's do that right now

sensor epics for shopping cart

cancelling orders shopping interface and

product search are all associated with

shopping for product items let's color

code these all a similar bluish or dark

teal

color now they don't all have to be the

same bluish color just as long as they

have roughly the same color Hue and

[Music]

intensity all right so now we've

colorcoded the epex for shopping cart

cancelling orders shopping interface and

product search and that way it's a

little bit easier for for us to identify

which one is associated with a specific

functionality so now let's color call

the epics for user account and loyalties

program an orange-ish color because

they're associated with the user admin

side of things so for user account let's

choose the color for

orange all right so for loyalties

program let's go in let's view details

and let's change the color of this to

also a different slightly maybe like a

dark yellow color as well and lastly for

the Epic for shopping location let's

color Cod it a red color since it's tied

to store

information and voila now we've already

colorcoded all the different epics so

it's a little bit more visually easier

to identify and categorize each epic

based upon its category now before we

start creating our issues within our

project make sure to smash that like

like button if you're getting any value

out of this  tutorial and to subscribe to

the channel for more  tutorials like this

all right so let's go ahead and create

the user stories for our epics starting

with our first epic for the shopping

cart so going back to our Jira project

to create an issue you can either click

the blue create button at the top of

your screen or you can press the

keyboard shortcut button for C and then

this window will appear

so inside this dialogue box you can see

that we're underneath the project for

eCommerce shopping app and the issue

that we want to create right now is for

a story so let's select that for

now the status of course will be to do

since we haven't yet started the Sprint

and for the summary I'm going to type in

the user story for checking out items in

the shopping

cart all right so we have the summary in

there right now so we have as a customer

I want to check out the items from my

shopping cart so that I can pay from my

selected items for the parent link this

is where we want to choose the Epic for

the shopping

cart all right so let's choose the one

for shopping cart Esa -1 and for the

description I like to use this space to

define the acceptance criteria that

you'll agree upon with your team so

let's copy what I have already

pre-written from my guide and let's

paste it into

here all right so that looks good let's

leave everything else as is and then

let's click the blue create

button we can see right away that our

new user story for checking out items

from my shopping cart has been added

inside of our backlog so let me explain

what each part of this row is inside of

the back back log the first icon at the

very left is the box that tells you what

kind of issue type it is so in this case

this icon right here represents the user

story next we have our issue key which

is just the project key itself Esa for

Ecommerce shopping app followed by the

issue number so the number eight and to

the right of this we have the issue

summary being displayed in one line and

to the right of the summary we have the

f

type that this falls under which in this

example is for the shopping cart the

next column is for the status of this

user story which is to do the gray

Circle towards the very right is the

number of story points that your team

estimates that it would take to complete

this user story and that's what you

typically do during your Sprint planning

meeting we haven't filled this

information out so let's leave it as

blank and then we have the priority

level of lowest low low high and highest

and then to the right of that we have

the person who this issue is assigned to

if you want to let's say view the

details of this issue left click the

summary of the issue and all the details

will appear on the right panel to the

right if you want to open up the issue

in a separate window then left click the

issue number that's next to the icon so

left click Esa d8 and it should appear

in a separate

tab now we can see all of the details of

this user story in a much larger viewing

window you'll see everything that we

entered in for the description so the

acceptance criteria that we typed in as

well as all the details on the right

hand side as well as activities so the

comments history of what's happened to

this user story and worklog if any

specific users track in their work so

for now let's go back to our backlog

since we do have several more user

stories that we need to create there is

another way to quickly create issues and

that is by clicking on the plus create

issue button that is at the backlog

section so making sure that none of the

epics are selected let's click on the

plus create issue

button for now let's add in the next

user story for reviewing items in the

cart

so now that we've edited in press enter

so now we've entered that in and what

you'll notice is that you'll have to

fill in any of the other details that we

typically filled out previously at a

later time period because we do have to

assign still the Epic and all the other

labels as well so in general this is a

very quick way to create issues but you

will have to go back to each issue and

add in the appropriate descriptions and

details at a later time for now let me

input the remaining user stories that

are a part of our project and you can

follow along as I do

[Music]

this so now we've added in all of our

user stories let's add in a few bugs to

the project so we can also visualize how

this would look during a Sprint you'll

notice that when I click on the plus

create issue button here you can change

the issue type to be the bug which in

this case is just a red box with a white

circle to indicate that it is a bug so

let's repeat this and I'll copy and

paste all the other bug types for this

[Music]

project so now we've added in all of the

user stories and all the bugs now let's

say that for our very first user story

for checking out items from the shopping

cart we have several subtests that we

want want to keep track of so let's open

this up in a separate tab so we can have

a closer look at this let's say that we

have several subtest that we want to

keep track of so to add those subtests

to this user story click on the create

subtask button which is right below the

user Story summary line once you do that

this separate line will appear for

subtask so now let's input several

subtests that we believe are required to

complete this un user

story I'm going to press enter and it

will create the subtask automatically

let's do this again for the remaining

subtask for this user

story all right pressing return for the

last subtask and now we're done and so

you can see here that we have a full

list of subtasks which are tied directly

to this user story so let's go back to

our backlog and let let's refresh the

page so we can see what it looks like so

when we go back to the backlog we can

see that with this user story selected

we can see all the sub test that we just

inputed on the right hand panel now

let's add another group of subtask for

our third user story for updating the

number of items inside of our shopping

cart I'm going to open this up in a

separate tab that way it's a little bit

easier for us to type in and and enter

in all of his subtasks so let's do that

right

now all right so with that completed we

have now inputed all the different

subtests for this third user story so

with that completed let's go back to our

finalized backlog let's click the

refresh button at the top so it shows

all the latest data now this is a long

list of user stories and the idea here

is to get you familiarized and used to

seeing different kinds of isue types

within a backlog for your jro project

since we created our issues the fast way

using the plus create issue row at the

very bottom it doesn't assign the issues

to the appropriate epics so we need to

take care of that right now so to assign

a user story to an epic all you have to

do is left click one user story and then

drag and drop it to the appropriate epic

in the Epic panel on the left side so

for the second user story of reviewing

items inside your cart let's select it

left click it drag and drop into the

shopping cart epic once you do that

you'll notice that the shopping cart

epic has now been attached to this user

story now if there's a group of issues

that fall under the same epic category

then you can do this very quickly by

left clicking the chat Mark box to the

left of the issue and repeating it for

multiple issues and then dragging and

dropping them into the appropriate epic

label let's do that for the first epic

for the shopping

cart and voila all of them automatically

update to the shopping cart epic all

right and so let's do this for the

remaining user stories and their

corresponding epics for the cancelling

orders epic we have these two which need

to be assigned to the Epic for

cancelling orders

the next group is for the Epic for user

account and so it'll start with the user

story for logging into my account all

the way down to changing my password so

let's drag and drop it into the user

account

epic and you can see that the Epic

categor slowly start to populate across

all the different user stories with

different labels here the next category

is for the shopping interface so let's

start with the viewing the products

available in the store all the way down

to viewing which physical store location

that you want to see so let's drag and

drop it into the shopping interface

epic let's unselect those and then we'll

choose the ones for the Epic for product

search so starting from the top here I

want to search for items available in

the store and let's go all the way down

to showing personalized results of

products that I'm inter interested in

let's drag and drop this and put this

into the product search

epic all right now all that's remaining

is for the loyalties program and

shopping location epic so we have I want

to get discount coupons I want to

receive an anniversary discount and

refer a friend bonus discounts let's

drag and drop it into the loyalties

program right

now all right and then we have these

three remain in user stories and these

are all tied to the shopping location

epic all right everything is looking

pretty good so far all right so now

we've assigned all of the appropriate

issues to their corresponding epics and

you can see their epic category in the

right side column here Pro tip from me

each issue that you create in your

backlog should only correspond to one

Epic that way this ensures that the work

that your team is performing is aligned

with the product vision and what the

team is trying to build during the

Sprint now a really cool feature with

Jira is how easy it is to filter and

quickly see which items correspond to an

epic so on the left epic panel when you

click on shopping cart for example you

will only see the issues that are

associated with the Epic for the

shopping cart if you want to see other

issues underneath the other epics then

you have to left click the Epic label

again that way it deselects it and then

you can repeat the process so you can

quickly see which user stories are

assigned to a different epic so for

example these are all the user stories

tied to shopping interface for loyalties

program here are all the different user

stories that are assigned to it and of

course here are the ones for product

search so again it's very helpful and

it's very easy to quickly identify which

user stories are tied to the appropriate

epic so by this point we have populated

our entire backlog or what's known as

our product backlog that will be used to

develop our e-commerce shopping software

app we have created several epics that

are linked to different user stories

tasks and bugs and we have color coded

each epic so that they're easier to

identify and filter now let's take a

look at how you can categorize your

issues using what's called labels so

it's easier for you to identify and

search for them in your project and

later on you'll be able to filter out

your issues based on these labels now

think of a label as a onew piece of text

to categorize similar user stories tasks

or bugs Jira doesn't currently let you

type two separate words as a label so if

you do have to use two separate words

then use an underscore or a dash between

the two words so for our e-commerce

shopping software application we'll

label all user stories that are under

our epics as follows for the epics for

shopping cart canceling orders shopping

interface and product search we'll use a

label that's called shopping now

everything that's tied to the management

of the user Administration and the

account handling side of things will

label these issues as a user admin so

that will be for all the issues that are

underneath the two epics for user

account and loyalties program and lastly

for any user story that's tied to

displaying store information we'll label

it as store info so let's hop back into

Jira and I'll show you how to label

these issues all right so now we're back

into the backlog interface when you

click on a user story for example this

one the right panel will appear when we

scroll down to the details area you'll

see a separate section called labels

this is where you can type in your onew

text to categorize your issue for this

specific issue since it's underneath the

parent epic for shopping cart let's call

this label for

shopping and then we'll select this so

it's a new label so now that it's

applied let's click return so now we can

see that the shopping label has been

applied to this specific user story

let's click on the second user story in

the backlog and let's go down to the

label section right here when you click

on the drop- down menu you'll see our

newly created label for shopping appear

right here so let's click it and then

click outside of that area to finalize

our choice So Pro tip from me to quickly

label an issue after you select it all

you have to do is press the key keboard

button for L and it will take you

directly to the label dropdown and

you'll be able to select the label for

your issue so now with that said let's

go ahead and let's label all the other

issues underneath the epics for

cancelling orders shopping interface and

product search as

shopping and as you go through this

you'll start to see how easy it becomes

once you start using the keyboard L

shortcut button to quickly label

your user

stories so now we're going to repeat the

labeling for shopping interface I'll use

my keyboard shortcuts that way we can go

through this very

quickly and rinse and repeating that for

the Epic for product search

[Music]

now let's label all issues underneath

the epics for user account and loyalties

with a label of user

admin you'll notice that I'm typing in

the label with the hyphen in between

them or a dash because you generally

want to only use one word to

characterize your label so I'll type in

user-

admin and we'll repeat this for the

remaining user stories that are

underneath the Epic for user

account and you'll find that it's really

straightforward and easy to add in the

labels once you've already set them up

into your

system let's do this again for the ones

for the loyalties

[Music]

program and lastly let's label all the

issues underneath the Epic for shopping

location with the label as store

info all right so now we've labeled all

of our user stories with the correct

label with Jira we can quickly filter

which issue is tied to the appropriate

label by using this label filter that's

at the top so an example here are all of

the different issues that are associated

with the label for

shopping so everything that's tied to

the Epic for shopping cart cancelling

orders shopping interface and product

search if we go back we can select only

the issues tied to store info which is

for shopping location and then for user

Administration we have all the user

stories tied to user account and the

loyalties program by the way as we move

on to the next section make sure to

smash that like button if for gaining

any value out of this  tutorial all right so

now we have our complete list of backlog

items with user stories tasks and bugs

tied to the appropriate labels and epics

now Jira has two more tools that allow us

to prioritize and sort through all of

our issues and they are what's called

components and versions let's first talk

about components if you open up the left

side panel you'll see a separate module

for components if you click it you'll

see here that it's completely empty at

last thing it will tell you about the

compass component section but they also

have one that's specific to Jira

components and you can see here that

it's completely empty because we haven't

created any components at this point in

time as Jira says it right here

components are subsections of a project

and you want to use them to group issues

within a project into smaller parts

components are very similar to labels

but to create them you do likely need to

be an admin but since you created your

project with your own Jira account you

should have the ability to create

components for your project as an

example of how you would use components

let's say that you're developing a

software application you could have two

separate components for the different

platforms the app would Opera in for

example iOS versus Android or Windows

versus Mac OS and B B on the component

type would mean that the issue will be

assigned to the appropriate engineer to

work on so similar to labels you can use

filters based on the components and see

the issues which are tied to that

component so let's go ahead and create

two components for our project first

click on the create component button and

you should see this dialogue box pop up

for our first component let's call it

iOS for description let's type in

compatibility for iOS

devices for component lead let's assign

this to yourself so in my case I'll type

in Alvin and then for default assigning

let's select component lead and that way

it'll assign it to yourself click save

and we'll now see that we've created our

first component I'm going to ignore this

popup for compus and instead we're going

to focus only on the things tied to Jira

components for now we have our first

component so we have the component name

component description who the component

lead is the default assigning which in

this case is the component lead for any

issues that are associated with this

component and then we have the number of

issues tied to this component let's

create our second component for Android

by clicking on the create blue button on

the top right side of your screen let's

call the second component Android and

for description let's type in

compatibility for Android devices let's

leave the other fields blank for now and

let's click on Save let me show you how

components can be assigned to issues so

let's go back to our backlog interface

so we can see all the different issues

inside of our backlog let's click on the

first user story right here so it pops

it open the details on the right hand

side let's click on on the issue number

so it pops open in its own separate tab

on the right hand side of the screen

underneath the details area where there

it says more Fields there should be a

separate section called components if

you left click this box you're going to

see a drop- down menu and you can choose

appropriate component that is tied to

this user story so for example of

purposes let's assign this user story to

the iOS component

when we click out of it we'll see that

this iOS component has been assigned to

this user story so when you assign

components to your other issues you'll

be creating a hierarchical structure for

your project that way it's easier to

identify which user stories and tasks

are tied to iOS development or Android

software development for example all

right so let's go back to our component

interface so when we click on comp

components will be taken to this screen

when we click on the number of issues

that are tied to the iOS component right

here what we'll see is a different

search area that's showing all the

different issues that are tied to the

component for iOS in our case it will

only show us the one issue that we just

assigned to it so this is very helpful

if you have a lot of user stories tied

to the development of different software

platforms that you need to manage and

sort through and for now let's go back

to our main project and let's talk about

how we can use versions to track the

releases of specific features of our

software app project on the left hand

side of the panel there is a releases

interface module here so click it and

you should now see this screen as Jira

says it right here versions help you

package and schedule project deliveries

as a release of your work for software

projects your releases will usually be

something like release 1.0 1.1 2.0 and

so on so let's create a version by

clicking on the create version button

for our first version of the software

that we're developing let's call it

version one for our start date let's say

that we're starting on January 15 2024

and that our plan release date is about

6 months from now by n of Q2 2024 so

that would

let's say June 28th of this year for

description let's say that the purpose

of this initial release is to allow

customers to buy products

online let's click save and we'll see

right away that we now have a version

one populated in this table the status

of course is still unreleased no issues

have been linked to version one yet and

so the progress is no issues and to the

right of these s we see our planed start

date and our planed release date for

releasing this software version to our

customers and finally we see the overall

description of the purpose of this

software version now let's go back to

our backlog interface so we can see how

versions can be linked to our issues

whether it's a user story a task or a

bug on the top bar menu right here

you'll see a drop- down menu for

versions click on it it and then select

version similar to how our epic panel is

versions also have a separate panel that

way it's easier to access and see which

issues are linked to the appropriate

software release Pro tip from me if you

press the keyboard button for V it will

expand or collapse the left panel for

versions that way it's much easier to

access so let's close out the epics

panel and let's focus only on versions

for now now if you click on the Arrow

next to version 1.0 you'll see all the

details that are tied to this software

release we see it General description

that we just defined earlier as well as

a number of issues that have been

assigned to it and those that have been

completed we also see the plan start and

plan release date for this version now

to link our issues to version 1.0 all

you have to do is drag and drop our user

stories on on top of it so let's drag

and drop our first user story onto

version

one and you'll see that the user story

has now been labeled as version one so

let's go ahead and let's add all the

issues under the Epic for shopping cart

cancelling orders and shopping interface

to version one pro tip from me you can

quickly select multiple issues and drag

and drop them onto the version so it

classifies them much faster

let's rinse and repeat that for the Epic

for counseling orders and let's tie that

to version

one let's also tie the version one to

the Epic for shopping

interface all right so now we've added

in these version one releases to the

Epic for shopping cart cancelling order

and shopping interface now let's say

that we want the issues underneath the

epics for user account and product

search to be underneath the next

software release for version 2.0 so to

create the next version click on the

plus create version button in the left

panel let's call our version version

2.0 and let's put in here for the plan

start date let's say that it's going to

be July 88th

and then for the plan release date let's

say that it's going to be September

30 let's leave the driver to be me still

and for description let's say that this

is the Beta release for user accounts

and product

searches and then we'll click on

save all right so now let's go in and

drag and drop the user stories

underneath the epics of user account

and product search into the second

version to make this fast let's left

click the check mark box for each of

these ones under the Epic for user

account and let's drag and drop this

underneath version

2.0 and then we'll see version 2.0

labeled and categorized for these user

stories and then let's rinse and repeat

this for the Epic for product

search all right so now we've labeled

those two Epic with version 2.0 and all

that's remaining is now the next version

for version 3.0 all right so now let's

create version 3.0 which will store the

remaining user stories and bugs let's

call it version

3 and let's have it have a start date at

the beginning of

October with a planned release date by

the end of December of

2024 and for description let's call it

added loyalties

program and shopping location

interface let's now go ahead and assign

the remaining issues to version

3.0 and then for the other bugs that we

have here let's add that into the

software version for

1.0 now we've assigned all user stories

to the appropriate software version

release so when you click version one

for example example you'll only see the

issues that are applicable for that

software release so this feature of Jira

and being able to filter based upon the

version release itself is extremely

helpful to prioritize and see which work

items will be prioritized on its

upcoming software release for its

General product road map and you can see

the general overview of all the releases

when you click on the releases interface

right here so when you expand it out you

can see everything that we created

previously so version 3 version 2.0 and

version one if let's say that all of the

user stories underneath release version

one is ready for release then all you

have to do is go all the way to the

right hand side click on the three dots

icon and then select release now for the

purposes of this  tutorial we won't be

releasing anything at this point in time

so we can move on and talk about

managing our backlog and doing what's

called backlog grooming all right so one

of the most important aspects of leading

agile projects is prioritizing your

team's work based on which features

bring the most value to the customers in

other words what features must they have

so the product can be used and with

agile it's very important to prioritize

and rank your issues against each other

so it's clear what work needs to happen

in the upcoming Sprint and typically the

one responsible for doing this will be

the product owner the product manager

and in some instances depending on the

company and how your roles expectations

are set up the agile project manager or

scrum Master those two may help out as

well and facilitate those discussions so

going back to Jira here you put your full

list of work inside of this entire

backlog and Jira allows us to drag and

drop each issue whether it's a user

story or a bug into the appropriate

order and in doing that we're changing

the priority of each issue so for

example if I drag and drop the third

user story above the second one then

that means that it has a higher priority

than the one we pushed right below it

this is a very simple concept to

understand but it's actually harder to

understand an Implement in real life

especially if you have a long list of

more than 20 to 50 items that you need

to rank and prioritize all at once and

it can feel extremely overwhelming so

let me share with you my own tips with

how you can prioritize and groom your

product backlog all right now since

we've already classified our work based

on the software versions that will be

releasing let's toggle the versions

panel by pressing the keyboard button

for V that way it expands and we will

only select version one for now that way

we only focus on the items of work that

need to be released as soon as possible

for the first initial software release

and as you can see the number of issues

that we have to prioritize has gone down

by more than half which makes it less

overwhelming for us so instead of

originally 44 issues we now just have to

prioritize 16 issues since versions two

and version three won't be released

anytime soon we can focus our efforts

only on versions one features which must

be released in the next few months so

let's take a look and let's go through

all the items in our backlog for version

1.0 the first user story is for checking

out items from the shopping cart since

it's very important for customers to be

able to place items for purchasing let's

leave this as a number one priority for

now let's go down to the second user

story and we see here that this one is

to review the items in the shopping cart

let's keep this as a lower priority than

the first one I want you to note here

that as we're going through the backlog

you'll see that I only prioritize issues

going upward and not downward meaning I

focus on sending items up the top

portion of the backlog and not downward

I like to review each issue line by line

and compare it to the ones above it if

the issue is not that important then I

do not send it to the bottom of the

backlog I like to leave it as is and I

go on to the next issue until I find one

that has a higher priority and from my

own experience this makes grooming the

backlog a much more easier and

simplified process so you only have to

go through the backlog one time instead

of having to repeat and go through it

multiple multiple times the third user

story for updating the number of items

in the shopping cart does not have a

higher priority so let's leave it as is

and let's go to the next one now we can

see here that the next two user stories

are about customizing the customer's

shipping address for our example let's

say that these two user stories are

higher priority than being able to

update the items in the shopping cart so

let's left click click the check mark

box to the side of these issues and

let's drag and drop them above the user

story for updating the number of items

in the shopping cart when we let go it

automatically ranks it higher than the

story for updating the items in the

shopping cart let's now move on to the

next issue which is the user story for

adding in credit card information since

this involves allowing a customer to pay

for their purchase let's say that this

user story has a higher priority than

the one above it so let's left click it

and drag and drop it above that line

item now the next user stories are tied

to cancelling orders which do not have a

higher priority than the ones for the

user stories underneath the Epic for

shopping cart so let's leave these as is

for now the next user story is for

viewing products available in the store

and this has a higher priority than the

user stories for cancelling orders so

let's drag these above these two in

terms of ranking and priority now we

have the next user story which is for

choosing the size and quantities for the

items that the customer wants now this

user story has a higher priority than

the user story for updating the items in

the cart so let's drag and drop it above

these

ones this us story also has a higher

priority than adding in the credit card

information or customizing the shipping

address so let's drag and drop it above

those in terms of priority all right now

going back to this user story which is I

want to view products available in the

store this one well customers must be

able to view products that are available

in the store before they can actually

make a purchase so this story would

technically have a number one priority

so let's drag and drop it above the

first user story for checking out items

in the shopping cart all right now we

have the next two user stories for

viewing the sales price of similar items

in the catalog this one seems like it

would have a higher priority because

it's tied to viewing the products in the

store so that they can make a purchase

so let's make this a higher priority

than being able to customize your

shipping address and possibly even

reviewing the items in the cart so let's

make it a number three priority in terms

of the backlog so now the top three

items in the backlog are viewing

products available in the store I want

to check out items from my shopping cart

and viewing sales price of similar items

in the catalog for purchase now for the

remaining issues that are inside our

backlog these have not yet been

prioritized for the first bug this is an

error when the user tries to check out

with the shopping cart since this is

tied to being able to check out items

from my shopping cart let's

drag and drop this below the priority of

the checking out items user story in

terms of priority that way it at least

gets prioritized in the top three for

the next one we have search results do

not appear when using the Android mobile

app for this one since this is more tied

to searching let's leave it as is and

actually let's drag and drop this so

that way we can move it to a higher

priority so it's right below the the

first error message and for the other

bug for Windows do not resize when the

app begins loading since this is a lower

severe bug and defect let's leave it as

is and for the final bug where the

incorrect amount of bills and expenses

adds up during checkout this seems like

a very critical issue that does need to

be resolved so let's drag and drop into

a higher priority right below being able

to ensure that search results do appear

so now we have reprioritized all the

items in our backlog the first five are

viewing products available in the store

checking out items from the shopping

cart fixing the different bugs tied to

checking out the cart fixing search

results and fixing the correct amounts

of bills and expenses when you're

checking out items that are more than

five quantities so now we've groom the

entire backlog for all of the features

that must be developed for the first

release of our software again this is

just an example to show you how to groom

your backlog and how to prioritize and

rank each user story using Jira now

before we can set up our Sprints we need

to make sure that everything inside our

backlog is set up correctly first is

every issue assigned to an epic so to do

that pull up your backlog and let's open

up the Epic panel left click and choose

the option for issues without epics for

any issues which do not have an assigned

epic we want to assign them

appropriately epics are very important

because they make sure that all of our

user stories and tasks especially bugs

are aligned to the features and the

goals of the product that we're

developing so in this case we forgot to

assign these bugs to the correct epics

so let's go through this line by line

error message when user tries to check

out with shopping cart this is tied to

shopping cart so let's drag and drop it

right here the second one is tied to

search results so let's tie it to

product search the next bug is tied to

shopping cart for incorrect amounts so

again that's tied to shopping cart and

then this one is more of Windows does

not resize when the app begins loading

this one is more of a shopping interface

so let's drag and drop it here all right

so everything looks good and we have now

assigned all the issues to the

appropriate epics as we can see see on

the screen right here now the next thing

to do is to make sure that our backlog

items are assigned with the correct

version so let's pull up the version

panel by pressing the V keyboard

shortcut or by left clicking on the

version menu right here now let's click

on the button for issues without

versions and we can see that we have a

handful of issues that are not tied to a

specific software release it's important

to assign these correctly ly so it's

clear when we plan to release certain

features so let's go ahead and assign

all these issues to version one to do

that we'll bulk select all of these

issues by pressing the shift button and

then we'll drag and drop them onto

version one all right so now that we've

done that this will automatically

correct itself and there are no issues

that have been labeled without the

correct version so if we click on

version one everything is correctly

labeled as version one as we can see

right here and if you deselect version

one as you scroll through it all issues

and user stories have been labeled with

the correct version and version one

consists of all the user stories tasks

and bugs that need to be worked on as

soon as possible for our very first

software release all the other versions

are a much lower priority since these

will not be released until later on in

the year all right so now that we've

groomed our entire backlog and we

prioritized the issues for our first

release let's set up the very first

Sprint for our project now before we do

that don't forget to smash that like

button so I know you like and appreciate

my content now Jira already pre-re your

Sprint for you when you initially set up

your project but let's say that you

don't have your Sprint already created

so let me show you how to create your

Sprint so I I've deleted it already and

to create your Sprint all you have to do

is click on the button that says create

Sprint and when you do that you'll see a

new drop- down section appear for the

first Sprint which is called Esa Sprint

one and in the middle area right here is

where we can drag and drop the different

user stories that we want our team to

work on for the current Sprint and so

when you're using the scrum framework as

a scrum master or agile project manager

during your Sprint planning meeting

you're going to work with a product

owner and your team to identify which

issues are the ones that your team can

realistically complete based on the

required effort using an estimate that's

known as story points now when we look

at the issues inside the backlog you'll

notice that there are these gray circles

with a line through them this is where

you assign store story points to each

user story in other words what is the

amount of effort that your team thinks

is required to complete it and to assign

user stories it's typical for teams to

pull numbers from a modified version of

the Fibonacci sequence from the

following 1 2 3 5 8 and 13 and I'll show

a matrix table on the screen right here

that way you can have it for your

reference so it's clear what story Point

corresponds to the amount of effort time

and task complexity for our example

let's go through the first several user

stories and assign story points to them

again in real life projects you want to

work with your team to provide you with

these story Point estimates for our

first user story of viewing products in

the store let's say that this will take

a moderate amount of effort and likely a

few days of time so let's assign it a

user story point value of five and then

we'll click the check mark box that

appears andol uh we're again we're doing

this based on the Matrix table that I'm

showing on the screen right here for our

second user story of checking out items

from the shopping cart let's say that

this requires a severe amount of effort

and it will take roughly at least a week

due to the medium complexity of work

involved so let's assign a story point

value of

N8 so for today's purpose of this

tutorial we're only going to be

assigning story points to the user

stories so we're going to skip over the

bugs for now the next user story is for

viewing the sales price of similar items

in the catalog so as you can see as

we've started assigning story points to

each user story we can see that this

number has already started

pre-populating and summing up the number

of story points that are user stories

have been assigned to so in this case we

have a total story Point number of 13

let's skip over our bugs for now and

let's move on to our next two user

stories for these two let's assign both

of them story Point values of

five and for our fifth user story let's

assign it a value of eight story points

and for our sixth user story let's

assign in a value of three story points

and right away we can see that we've

already estimated a total of 34 story

points now let's say that your team

agrees that this amount of work that

we've already calculated here is the

total amount of work that the team can

commit to completing for the current

upcoming Sprint in the next two weeks so

to assign these issues to the current

Sprint all you have to do is left click

the check mark box to the left of the

user stories and pressing shift all the

way down to the last user story so now

we've selected the user stories plus the

bugs and then let's drag and drop them

into the current

Sprint and voila we have all user

stories and bugs with a total of 34

story points assigned to the current

Sprint number one again these user

stories have not yet been assigned to a

team member since this is just a sample

project for playing with so you can get

familiar with how to use Jira let's

assign all of these different user

stories and bugs to yourself which in

this example would be my name AKA

Alvin and in real life projects you

would actually assign different user

stories to multiple people so that each

person is not overloaded beyond their

work capacity so on the right hand side

with a person icon you'll do what I just

did and will assign it to the

appropriate person so now all user

stories for the upcoming Sprint number

one have been assigned to the correct

person and they've kept their

prioritization from when we prioritized

and groomed the

[Music]

backlog so to start the Sprint all you

have to do is click on the blue button

that says start Sprint and then we'll

see this window pop up for the Sprint

name let's leave the Sprint name as Esa

Sprint one and for duration in real life

projects I like to usually set this to

be 2 weeks but for the purposes of this

 tutorial tutorial let's do a custom

duration for start date I'll put today's

date which is January 1 New Year right

and then for the end date we're going to

put jary one as well and so that I can

show you everything for using Sprints

I'm going to have this finished in the

next 45 minutes so that should be

roughly by 4:30 p.m. that way I can walk

you through what the Sprint will look

like when it's completed and I can

demonstrate how it works for the Sprint

goal let's say that the goal is to

create the checking out functionality in

the software

app now let's click the blue button for

start and when we do that Jira

automatically takes us to the Sprint

conon board and has already populated it

with all the user stories assigned to

the to-do column so all the user stories

as well as the different tasks that are

tied to this user story and if I

Collapse it you can see everything that

has already been created inside of

here we see here also that the subt for

the first user story are shown below it

with the remaining user stories

occupying their own visual card now if

we click a card for the first user story

or the subtask it'll pop open on the

right hand side so we can see all of the

details unfortunately this is a simple

board with only three columns for Todo

in progress and done and in real life

projects you might need to customize it

to suit the needs of your te team and

the best practices for your

organization's approach so to keep this

 tutorial tutorial a little bit more

simplified we're going to be focusing

only on the user stories and subtask

that we've put inside of our Sprint so

to customize our scrum board to suit the

needs of your team or let's say your

organization all you need to do is click

on the three dots button right here at

the top right corner and then select

configure

board after you wait for a little bit

it's it's going to pop open the settings

for the esa board now we want to go to

the settings for columns we can see here

the three different columns that Jira

has already created for us for our

workflow we have too in progress and

done for our workflow let's create

another column called to verify so let's

click on the plus symbol right here and

let's call this new column to

verify we'll leave category as is for

now and we'll click on ADD column so now

we have our updated status and updated

columns so we have to do in progress to

verify and done so if we go back to our

project to our scrum board this is what

we're going to see we're going to see

the updated columns that we just

implemented with to verify right between

in progress and done now during your

Sprint when you're reviewing your team's

progress on their completed task and

user stories all all you have to do is

drag and drop the subtask or the user

story Into the appropriate column so as

an example let's drag and drop this

subtask called right acceptance test and

review Into the column for in progress

and you'll see that it now has moved and

the number here for in progress has now

changed to three and then of course the

goal is to move all items from too all

the way to done so let's go ahead and

move these three subtasks all the way to

done so you can see what that looks like

and you can see that once it hits done a

green box appears right around it to

Showcase that it's been completed and

the key ID number for that issue has

been crossed out showing that it has

been completed now let's say that we

finished all subtasks for the first user

story so let's drag and drop all of them

across the different Columns of this

scrum board and then we'll do our best

to put them under underne the done

column and when you do that you're going

to see that this new window appears all

subtests for parent issue are now

complete do you want to update this

parent issue to match so let's click

undone and let's click update to reflect

that accordingly to have your board

reflect that this user story has now

been completed click the refresh button

for your window and it should change to

reflect done so now this user story has

been marked completed collapsing this

user story we now have the other user

stories that we do need to complete for

this Sprint so let's go ahead and let's

drag and drop a few of the other user

stories into the next two columns to

Showcase their progress for our team's

work and we'll put a few on to verify

and a few in progress and voila we've

completed two user stories in done we

have one in the status of to verify one

in progress and one that's still to do

as we're doing this you'll also notice

that the number of issues that shown

next to each status column also changes

to reflect this progress Pro tip usually

in real life projects as you update each

user story you want to input a comment

into each user story as I'm showing on

the

screen all right so in this comment I

put in work has started and coding has

developed of of course this comment will

be dependent upon what your team member

actually does they may even go in

themselves to input the update but at

least this shows you the idea that you

can input comments to reflect the latest

progress on different subtasks and user

stories by the way in the top right

portion of the Sprint you'll see a clock

showing how much time is left before

your Sprint is over this is just a neat

feature that Jira has so you'll have it

in mind as you're reviewing your team's

work now that we've gone through the the

different user stories for this Sprint

and we've pushed them from Todo to done

let's close out this Sprint by clicking

on the complete Sprint Blue Button we'll

now see this new dialogue window pop

open we have the opportunity to select

where we want our unresolved open issues

to be moved into whether it's a new

Sprint or to the backlog it's also kind

of cool because it tells us how many

issues have been completed and how many

issues are still open in our case we

have two open unresolved issues as best

practice I like to have my unfinished

user stories moved back to the backlog

so that they can be re-evaluated by the

product owner and the team for what the

priorities should be so let's select the

backlog for now and then click complete

Sprint all right so now Jira has updated

it and right now we've been taking out

side of our combine board View and we're

back into our backlog in the versions

panel to the right we now see a progress

bar of how many user stories have been

marked done and how many are still in

progress so four out of 16 are done and

one out of 16 are in progress and at the

end of every Sprint you'll also gain

access to different reports to do that

click on the reports menu on the left

side panel you can review different

kinds of reports such as the burn up the

burn down chart as well as the Sprint

chart so let me show you real quickly

what that looks like so this is the

burnd down chart again this will not be

what it would actually look like since

we did finish it very quickly this would

then be the burnup chart and then this

is then the Sprint report so for the

scope of this  tutorial tutorial let's go

through the Sprint report here we have

an overview of our burndown chart and at

the bottom we have a status report of

how many issues our team completed and

the issues which were not completed for

our burndown chart this is just an

example of what you might see as a

disclaimer the chart that I'm showing

you right now would not be

representative of what you would

actually see for your real life projects

since we did try to finish everything in

less than 30 minutes as a disclaimer

this is just a demonstration so you

could see what it's like to move

different user stories and items from

the different columns all the way to

done and at the bottom this is your

status report where you can review your

data with your team and discuss what

happened and what was a road block that

prevented us from completing these

remaining user stories and in so doing

you're planning ahead for how your team

can perform better for the next upcoming

Sprint in other words what can we do in

the next Sprint to prevent this from

happening now if you have too many

issues that are showing not completed

then it's likely that your team was too

optimistic and they overestimated how

much effort it would take to actually

complete the work all right so if you

stuck with me this far you have now

mastered how to use Jira for beginners
