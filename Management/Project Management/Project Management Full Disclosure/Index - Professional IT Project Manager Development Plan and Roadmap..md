training mid- to senior-level project managers and a wealth of practical experience managing projects ranging from simple to highly complex, the need for practical guidance in the field is in need and to become proficient in all areas of project management required in the real world with real people.
### **Prior to moving on to the plan, it is important that you read this...**
##### The **ONE** Skill That You Must Develop
**Project management is not like a puzzle** -  where every piece has a fixed place and a single, predetermined solution. 

there isn’t just one “right” way to build. rather than being confined to a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach.

here, you can adapt, experiment, and rearrange the pieces to create something tailored to your vision and goals. **It’s more like Lego,**
you have the flexibility to use different tools, processes, and approaches to fit your unique project. where you combine different pieces to create something remarkable.

That’s why mastering **project tailoring** matters. 

**Project tailoring is the art and science of combining processes, tools, and frameworks to create a practical project management framework that works in the real world.**

 Piling up theoretical knowledge only to be seen as the manager who can’t deliver when it matters most (because you read it all on the internet), which is taking you nowhere? Tailoring the same matters to glide to meaningful results.

### Competencies of an IT Project Manager
Below is a hybrid competency matrix and a self-assessment checklist. It will help identify the essential skills to put together into your practical project management framework.

The idea is simple: read it. If you agree with the same and you know what it takes to tailor it in practice, tick the checkbox. If not, challenge yourself to explore the idea further.
