### **Practical Project Management**
we need a correct mindset towards project management.

### **What is a Project?** 
**Basic Question:** WHAT IS PROJECT MANAGEMENT?
> **basic answer:** A project is a time limited endeavor to create a unique product, service or result.
**standard and appropriate answer for

==WHAT IS PROJECT MANAGEMENT?==**
==We produce unique results in order to achieve a specific business goal. Therefore, **Project management is the application of skills, knowledge, and tools to increase a project's chances for success** in reaching its business objective, not to create some random products or services.==

as the definition says, a project is a time limited endeavor.
It means it has a start and an end -> most of the work happens in between the start and the end of a project.

This leads us to the first critical project management concept:
###### **Project life cycle**:

### **Project Life Cycle** 
###### Phases and Versions:
Right at the start of a project, we break it down into phases to make it more manageable. 

==phases usually include specific work to produce one of the pieces of our project.==

these phases may consist of work different in nature.  example, on a large software development project, we may have the following phases such as,
![[Pasted image 20241023123002.png]]
- Pre-sales
- project initiation,
- concept development,
- prototyping
- planning
- requirements
- definition
- UI designs
- development
- integration
- testing
- deployment
- hyper-care
- maintenance,
- handoff, 
- closure or support phases.
it's a long list of all possible phases but you don't use them all in every single project you lead.

If a big project, each phase may take several weeks to several months.
![[Pasted image 20241023123206.png]]
 If small sub projects with combined with essentials that these phases mixed together and it's hard to differentiate them. but!,

You can and should use different processes and tools or even different project management approaches in each phase.

NOT ONE JUST WORKS SIMPLY!. ==DIFFERENT FRAMEWORKS FOR DIFFERENT PHASES==

Eg: you'll use this current framework to manage the implementation phase
of a software project. this what precisely what agile project management and its working though with Scrum and Kanban works. 
![[Pasted image 20241023124818.png]]

But not always all the phases works well and applies for each of the approach or framework.
**APPROPRIATE APPROACH FOR APPROPRIATE WORK AND TEAMS.**
![[Pasted image 20241023125634.png]]

eg: with Scrum or Kanban works, but you'll never use Scrum to manage UI design creation or handoff phase. **APPROPRIATE APPROACH FOR APPROPRIATE WORK AND TEAMS.**

For such cases and phases, you'll use something simplistic. eg: you'll do task tracking techniques to manage tasks and their due dates for the same but not SCRUM and Kanban. (for design as we referred above)

### **Project's Environment** 
You see, the industry and niche where you work matters and will dictate the available life cycles and project management approaches for the same. But there is one more limiting factor of your choices for processes, tools, and
techniques that you can use. 

we run project not in a vacuum but always leading projects inside an environment of the organization where you work.
![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 130751.png]]
As a result, you always have many custom processes, policies, and tools that emerge from the organization's business administration.

![[Pasted image 20241023131608.png]]
> So you **can't** simply ignore the environment and do project management at your own discretion which end produce too much friction and inefficiency. so, 
> **==instead you have to play along with the environment.==**

IRL, each company develops its own project management approach based on its needs. Therefore, there is no such thing as ONE standard project management framework or structure. 

So, the Project Management is more like 
**multiple pieces tailored in one instead of having one out right from the box.** Having said this, not any courses and certification (such as PMI PMP, PRINCE2, SIX SIGMA, CSM, CAPM) won't make you a full stack project manager ever.

##### With this in mind, let's consider two cases.
1) you work in an organization and you run a so called in-house project. It's a project for the needs of the organization alone. Here, you have only
one environment to deal with.
![[Pasted image 20241023131958.png]]

2) you work in client-vendor relationships. You have your organization, a so-called performing (own) organization, and you have a client's organization. They operate in completely different ways and that's a real world challenge.
![[Pasted image 20241023133709.png]]

You have to take into account the requirements of both organizations to run a project and find common grounds. It includes life cycle, processes, tools, roles, responsibilities and approaches. here, you'll be provided with
hiring department, templates, project management software's, lessons learned, best practices from other projects and access to subject matter experts. here, 
**THE ENVIRONEMENT HELP RUNNING THE PROJECT!!** takes off the burden of organizing every aspect of the workplace for your team so you can focus on your project work.

> tldr: you should always align your project management approach based on and 
with the environment where you work. **Swim with the current, not against it.** 

### **Project Stakeholder Management** 
**WHAT or WHO is or are a Stakeholder?**
'A stakeholder is an individual group or organization' that 
may affect, be affected or perceive itself to be affected by a 
decision, activity or outcome  
... of a project.

in other words, your client, the project owners are your stakeholders, 
but likewise your boss, some team members and subject matter experts are also stakeholders of the project.
> stakeholders are all possible people and organizations who may gain or lose  because of your project. 

**IDENTIFY:**
![[stakeholderPieChart.png]]
There are many types of stakeholders and many reasons why they care about project and that's why you need to identify them all.

Here, you start using a stakeholder register to capture all the information about stakeholders. 
**REGISTER:**
![[Pasted image 20241023152902.png]]

**ANALYZE**:
and then you need to perform stakeholder analysis and decide how you want to interact with each of them.

![[Pasted image 20241023152959.png]]

**STRATEGIZE:**
**How to strategize the same?**
![[stakeholdermanagmenet.drawio.png]]
> **PM is responsible for collecting requirements from various dynamics of stakeholders:** (very critical highlighted point)
-  *Stakeholders provide requirements* (SERVICE, PRODUCTE, FUNCTION OR FEATURE)
- Some of them provide requirements towards the product or
service you need to create, (HOW IT HAS TO BE CREATED)
- others provide requirements towards your project management approach, (WHAT WAY IT HAS TO BE CREATED)
- Some they want you to use in their environment (DO IT BUT IN MY ENVIRONMENT)
**And the critical part is it's your responsibility to collect all the requirements from all stakeholders for your project.**

ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE:
*IRL, if you misidentifying important requirements, it'll be your fault.*
In the worst case scenario, this stakeholder 
- will use their authority to force you to include the requirements into the project. 
- You have to change your  project management plan,
- explain to other stakeholders how it would happen
- and maybe ask for additional budget and time
- and usually it's an unpleasant conversation
- or even it may put the whole project at risk of failure.

Eg: you have almost finished building an expensive house in the woods, but somehow you fail to identify an environmental organization
as a stakeholder.
It appeared your house didn't comply with their environmental policies for these area, which you failed to identify at the start of the project. Now you have to pay a fine and change the heating system of your house so it results in additional expenses and a rework. You must identify key stakeholders early in the project.
**That much of a hassle to go through if anything went sideways.**
>  likewise, you should be on the lookout for other stakeholders throughout the project's lifetime.


In the real world, if you work in the company for some time, you should already know many internal stakeholders. And in fact, you need to continuously build working relationships with them. 
Not only when your project starts and after that, you need to identify external stakeholders from the client side and those from your industry or niche that may impact your project. 
###### **Now we have set the stage for a project to start.**
So imagine the client's organization, 
![[Pasted image 20241025122551.png]]
**one** - they have a business need to develop a product or service -> but they don't have the expertise and human resources to do that.
**two** - They start searching for a vendor organization that can help.
**WHERE THE SALES TEAM COMES INTO PLACE.**
### **Pre-sale Phase** 
As a result, their representatives contact the sales team in your organization. That's how the pre-sales phase of a project begins. You see, before it gets into the project management reel, the sales team and the client should negotiate the terms and conditions of a contract.
![[Pasted image 20241025123412.png]]
 As a project manager, you may help the sales team to develop realistic terms. So You may need to perform super high level planning here to ensure visibility and identify the duration and the budget for the project.

*Here's a critical point, theoretical books on project management may mislead you. They talk about risk management way too late. In the real world, you start risk management activities in the pre-sales phase.* 
### **Project Risk Management Framework** 
You may have **CRITICAL RISKS** right at the beginning of the project. 
Moreover, there might be **URGENT RISKS** that you need to resolve right away. 

*Eg: such risks may embed a problem at the start of the project that will fire up late*
*during the execution, or it may simply kill the project's visibility before it starts because you missed an opportunity.* **That's why you do risk management continuously**. Here is a **SIMPLE FRAMEWORK:**
![[Pasted image 20241025132307.png]]
1) **Risk Identification Techniques:** You continuously apply risk identification techniques in all project activities.
 -> *simplest is to ask the: team and stakeholders*: **do you see any risk here?** after finding out all that,
2) **Risk Register**: you log or identify the risks into their risk register.
3) **Risk Analysis**:
- *Qualitative Risk Analysis* (!imp)
- *Quantitative Risk Analysis* 
-- after analysis, filter out the critical ones by 
4) **Selecting Risks** ->  **Develop Risk Responses** based on the analysis (PLANNING THE SAME IS !imp)
5) **Implement Risk Reponses**: if occurs
6) **Monitor** the same
7) Risk register and document the logs 
(cycle continues) More important is to identify the risks. LOOK OUT!
### **Project Contract** 
###### Back to pre-sales phase: (risk is a part of it)
The outcome of pre-sales should be assigned as contract with the client by concluding the decision with internal stake holders with the preferred project management approach that we tailored included
- feasibility analysis
- high - level planning
- contract negotiations,
should be contracted!
![[Pasted image 20241026101833.png]]
Quite often, clients talk about their real goals for the project during the pre-sales phase. BUT. here's the case! Pre-sales phase will be all fall more into pre-sales engineer or associate. There will be info available only about
> a contract doesn't include all those details of a project.
Instead it outlines only the overall business relationships between the organizations.

If you don't participate in this phase, you need to find a way to get access to the notes, emails, and agreements that were made here.

**IT IS OUR DUTY TO MAKE THINGS CLEARED FROM OUR SIDE IN-TERMS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT and COLLECT AS MANY INFO THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED OVER THE Pre-sales phase which will become handy in future.**

 On the other hand, a contract may have a strict deadline or total budget for the project. It's a constraint for you so you should know about it.
 ![[Pasted image 20241026103751.png]]

NEXT!  you need to **initiate a project.** *a transition from the sales and contract negotiations into project management.*
we need to identify three things:
1) Business Objective 
2) Results (as an outcome)
3) Boundaries (of the project)

in practice to initiate a project, we use a tool called a **project charter**.

### **Project Charter** 
In a nutshell, it is a practice that includes high level information about the project. This information that we accumulated is very important to have before we start planning process.

**Project charter is a simple text document.** can be in word, docs or in email or PM tools and keep them in it. A project charter usually includes

PROJECT CHARTER STRUCTURE:
1) Title 
2) Project Description
3) Authority level
4) Business Use case
5) Process Objectives
6) Pre-assigned resources
7) Stakeholders
8) Known requirements from the stakeholders
9) Product Description / Deliverable - description of the services/product -  major deliverables
10) assumptions
11) constraints
12) Measurable Project Objectives
13) Project approval requirements
14) High - level project risks
15) Signature of authorizing the charter. 
-- not a comprehensive description of the project but a project charter should be
no more than five pages long. *The shorter, the better.*

> IRL, you may need to create a formal document, but in most cases, you'll simply collect this information and talk through it with your project owners so you need to develop a common understanding of the project.

IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL! because in the process, you remove lots of miscommunications right at the start and also you begin to control the client's expectations. Helps showing the scope of the project,
- What are the boundaries of the project? And 
- whether the constraints look realistic to develop the results that were outlined in the project charter.
 but what's even more important that you should align all your future efforts with the project charter.

> question everything that doesn't align with the project goal or business case in this charter.

Now let me emphasize why it's so important to have a project charter and how we use all this information.
### **Collecting Requirements** 
After getting a sign off on the project charter, Should take a broader look of the project charter that we ensure we all have things available from all the vectors such as contract your clients, your environment, available tools, process and templates and everything else at your disposal.

 
![[Pasted image 20241026112330.png]]

must decide what project management approach to take and what frameworks to use. **it's all based on the project life cycle**. Doesn't mean that we need to invent something new.

Simply, you need to choose from one, two, maybe three available options that fits and adjust them a bit to the needs of a project for your organization. After that,

**you need to outline a project management plan**, A project plan may be a mandatory document in some industries so it should contain all the details. the majority of projects don't need a fully written plan.

so it's totally fine to keep it all in your head until all stakeholders understand how you manage the project. However, if you have never created a formal project management plan, I recommend doing this exercise at least once.

![[Pasted image 20241026114632.png]]

**Exercise:** Take the major project management knowledge domains that PMI describes:
- Integration,
- scope,
- time,
- cost,
- budget,
- quality,
- risk,
- stakeholders,
- communication,
- resources and
- procurement management.
Now list all the processes, tools, templates, and workflows inside your organization and illustrate how they interact with each other.

==**This exercise will help you identify weak spots and inefficiencies in your project management, approach and knowledge. plus, it will help you systemize your knowledge and understand the whole system. ==

now, planning the planning process abiding with the project management
approach that we chartered.

### **Project / Rolling Wave Planning** 
(following the selected project management approach)

There are two fundamental principles to follow: ()

**INTEGRATION PRINCIPLE:**
1) you plan the project specifically to reach the objective stated in the project charter.
2) you focus on specifying and digging deeper into the high level information
you captured in the chapter.

*which will safeguard you from spending resources on something clients didn't ask for. and help you keep your clients expanding demands within the constraints and boundaries of the project*

On the other hand, if clients want to adjust Project objectives, okay
but should update the charter, which will allow you to renegotiate project budget, timeline, and scope.

 the starting point of planning, we need to 
 - take high level requirements and
 - scope of the project from the project charter.
