### **Practical Project Management**
we need a correct mindset towards project management.

### **What is a Project?** 
**Basic Question:** WHAT IS PROJECT MANAGEMENT?
> **basic answer:** A project is a time limited endeavor to create a unique product, service or result.
**standard and appropriate answer for

==WHAT IS PROJECT MANAGEMENT?==**
==We produce unique results in order to achieve a specific business goal. Therefore, **Project management is the application of skills, knowledge, and tools to increase a project's chances for success** in reaching its business objective, not to create some random products or services.==

as the definition says, a project is a time limited endeavor.
It means it has a start and an end -> most of the work happens in between the start and the end of a project.

This leads us to the first critical project management concept:
###### **Project life cycle**:

### **Project Life Cycle** 
###### Phases and Versions:
Right at the start of a project, we break it down into phases to make it more manageable. 

==phases usually include specific work to produce one of the pieces of our project.==

these phases may consist of work different in nature.  example, on a large software development project, we may have the following phases such as,
![[Pasted image 20241023123002.png]]
- Pre-sales
- project initiation,
- concept development,
- prototyping
- planning
- requirements
- definition
- UI designs
- development
- integration
- testing
- deployment
- hyper-care
- maintenance,
- handoff, 
- closure or support phases.
it's a long list of all possible phases but you don't use them all in every single project you lead.

If a big project, each phase may take several weeks to several months.
![[Pasted image 20241023123206.png]]
 If small sub projects with combined with essentials that these phases mixed together and it's hard to differentiate them. but!,

You can and should use different processes and tools or even different project management approaches in each phase.

NOT ONE JUST WORKS SIMPLY!. ==DIFFERENT FRAMEWORKS FOR DIFFERENT PHASES==

Eg: you'll use this current framework to manage the implementation phase
of a software project. this what precisely what agile project management and its working though with Scrum and Kanban works. 
![[Pasted image 20241023124818.png]]

But not always all the phases works well and applies for each of the approach or framework.
**APPROPRIATE APPROACH FOR APPROPRIATE WORK AND TEAMS.**
![[Pasted image 20241023125634.png]]

eg: with Scrum or Kanban works, but you'll never use Scrum to manage UI design creation or handoff phase. **APPROPRIATE APPROACH FOR APPROPRIATE WORK AND TEAMS.**

For such cases and phases, you'll use something simplistic. eg: you'll do task tracking techniques to manage tasks and their due dates for the same but not SCRUM and Kanban. (for design as we referred above)

### **Project's Environment** 
You see, the industry and niche where you work matters and will dictate the available life cycles and project management approaches for the same. But there is one more limiting factor of your choices for processes, tools, and
techniques that you can use. 

we run project not in a vacuum but always leading projects inside an environment of the organization where you work.
![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 130751.png]]
As a result, you always have many custom processes, policies, and tools that emerge from the organization's business administration.

![[Pasted image 20241023131608.png]]
> So you **can't** simply ignore the environment and do project management at your own discretion which end produce too much friction and inefficiency. so, 
> **==instead you have to play along with the environment.==**

IRL, each company develops its own project management approach based on its needs. Therefore, there is no such thing as ONE standard project management framework or structure. 

So, the Project Management is more like 
**multiple pieces tailored in one instead of having one out right from the box.** Having said this, not any courses and certification (such as PMI PMP, PRINCE2, SIX SIGMA, CSM, CAPM) won't make you a full stack project manager ever.

##### With this in mind, let's consider two cases.
1) you work in an organization and you run a so called in-house project. It's a project for the needs of the organization alone. Here, you have only
one environment to deal with.
![[Pasted image 20241023131958.png]]

2) you work in client-vendor relationships. You have your organization, a so-called performing (own) organization, and you have a client's organization. They operate in completely different ways and that's a real world challenge.
![[Pasted image 20241023133709.png]]
You have to take into account the requirements of both organizations to run a project and find common grounds. It includes life cycle, processes, tools, roles, responsibilities and approaches. here, you'll be provided with
hiring department, templates, project management software's, lessons learned, best practices from other projects and access to subject matter experts. here, 
**THE ENVIRONEMENT HELP RUNNING THE PROJECT!!** takes off the burden of organizing every aspect of the workplace for your team so you can focus on your project work.

> tldr: you should always align your project management approach based on and 
with the environment where you work. **Swim with the current, not against it.** 

### **Project Stakeholder Management** 
**WHAT or WHO is or are a Stakeholder?**
'A stakeholder is an individual group or organization' that 
may affect, be affected or perceive itself to be affected by a 
decision, activity or outcome  
... of a project.

in other words, your client, the project owners are your stakeholders, 
but likewise your boss, some team members and subject matter experts are also stakeholders of the project.
> stakeholders are all possible people and organizations who may gain or lose  because of your project. 

![[stakeholderPieChart.png]]
There are many types of stakeholders and many reasons why they care about project and that's why you need to identify them all.

Here, you start using a stakeholder register to capture all the information about stakeholders. 
![[Pasted image 20241023152902.png]]
and then you need to perform stakeholder analysis and decide how you want to interact with each of them.
![[Pasted image 20241023152959.png]]

**How to strategize the same?**
![[stakeholdermanagmenet.drawio.png]]
-  Stakeholders provide requirements
- Some of them provide requirements towards the product or
service you need to create, 
- others provide requirements towards your project management approach, 
- Some they want you to use in their environment
**And the critical part is it's your responsibility to collect all the requirements from all stakeholders for your project.**

ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE:
IRL, if you misidentifying important requirements, it'll be your fault.
In the worst case scenario, this stakeholder 
- will use their authority to force you to include the requirements into the project. 
- You have to change your  project management plan,
- explain to other stakeholders how it would happen
- and maybe ask for additional budget and time
- and usually it's an unpleasant conversation
- or even it may put the whole project at risk of failure.

Eg: you have almost finished building an expensive house in the woods, but somehow you fail to identify an environmental organization
as a stakeholder.
It appeared your house didn't comply with their environmental policies for these area, which you failed to identify at the start of the project. Now you have to pay a fine and change the heating system of your house so it results in additional expenses and a rework. You must identify key stakeholders early in the project.
**That much of a hassle to go through if anything went sideways.**
>  likewise, you should be on the lookout for other stakeholders throughout the project's lifetime.

In the real world, if you work in the company for some time, you should already know many internal stakeholders. And in fact, you need to continuously build working relationships with them. Not only when your project starts and after that, you need to identify external stakeholders from the client side and those from your industry or niche that may impact your project. Now we have set the stage for a project to start.

Let's get back into the lecture room. So imagine the client's organization, they have a business need to develop a product or service, but they don't have the expertise and human resources to do that. They start searching for a vendor organization that can help.
### **Pre-sale Phase** 

As a result, their representatives contact the sales team in your organization. That's how the pre-sales phase of a project begins. You see, before it gets into the project management reel, the sales team and the client should negotiate the terms and conditions of a contract. As a project manager, you may help the sales team
to develop realistic terms.
