### Intro
---
Hello people! 

Finally!! Not for you, but for me. I've been making excuses, and after a long period of procrastination, I've finally hit the screen to type it all out. So, Here I am!!

I'm thrilled to embark on this blogging journey with you. I'm so excited and pumped up about this!

> Disclaimer:
Forgive me, and do not get offended. I don't follow any standards to comply in terms of writing or blogging.  I don't know any of those. I have no style. I'll be just typing it all, like texting a message, and sending it to be double-checked.

I will be covering all my areas of expertise, interests, and whatnot.

### What to expect
Expect nothing but pure yapping about my personal experiences, perspectives and perceptions. I'll be throwing all of them here to get it all off of my chest and do whatever you want with it!. 

Love you. I meant it! Your consideration to check my sh*t. It means a lot. I hope to deliver the best and not disappoint. 

Thank you for hopping by, taking your time, and going through each of my episodes.

### $whoami
Small intro. Myself Rithish. I am currently a DevOps engineer at a small-scale startup with three years of experience in the IT industry. 

Architecting digital twin, GIS, AI/ML, 3D, Game and simulation-based systems. Sorry for not dropping names; i signed a bunch of NDAs :)

I have been religiously following all things tech and the business around it over in India, obviously Silicon Valley, YC, and other parts of the world. All my keen areas are mentioned below.

I grew up in a city named Chennai. Born in a remote town named Namakkal,. 

In pursuit of long-term learning, I chase all my areas of interest, quench my cautious multipotentialite thirst (meaning: having multiple interests), and also not make any excuses for the things that I'd want to do. 

#### What is it all about?

I've been admiring the ever-evolving world of technology, software development, and the fascinating intersections of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

But my interests don't stop there. Beyond the confines of the tech realm, I find joy and inspiration in a wider range of spaces. 

I will be covering things that are all my areas of interest and expertise, such as art, technology, software development, devops, deep tech, defense, security, IoT, consumer hardware, music, astronomy, creator economy, business, SaaS, entrepreneurship, podcasting, personal experiences, and a lot more.

Another disclaimer: I will not be proficient but will deliver to the best of my knowledge; a mix of my perspective and my flow of narrative will be applied to the same.

These passions fuel my curiosity and shape my view of the world around me. Justification for what and how my writing will be all about.


#### Objective 

Through this blog, I aim to share insights, experiences, and discoveries from my diverse interests. By diving into the things that will be covered throughout the journey, I want to create a space where we can engage in thought-provoking discussions and exchange ideas.

But more than just sharing thoughts, my objective is to foster a community of like-minded individuals who are as passionate about the same things mentioned above. 

Together, we can learn, grow, and inspire each other to push the boundaries of what's possible.


So that, 
To cover more and go through the journey, I will gratefully obtain what these are going to offer. 

I look forward to building an organic, relevant audience, genuine relationships with the people that I admire, learning from the people who took unconventional career paths, seasoned individuals, pioneers, masters at their work, learning and growing from them, becoming an insider, and what not! 

So, whether you're an enthusiast or simply someone with a curious mind, I invite you to hop on this journey. Let's explore, create, and connect as we navigate through the exciting intersections of our interests.

Stay tuned for my drops, and let's do whatever!

I appreciate your effort. Many thanks!

 Till next time,
 Rithish
