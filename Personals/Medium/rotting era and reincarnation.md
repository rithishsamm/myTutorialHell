You might or might not go through a phase of everything downhill, things falling apart, a heartbreak, lost some you love, mental breakdown, burnout, anxiety, overwhelm,  helplessness, filled with self doubts, questions and pessimism. 

Must've gone through a shit you've never thought of. Unprecedented, unexpected or simply you didn't saw that coming. 

Little Disclaimer, This read may or may not be relevant. This read is an expression of my thoughts about this topic. I mean no harm to affect anyone's emotions or to be make sympathy to feel pity for whoever.

Would like to take you ages back to make a decent comparison of the ride you've been through your lifetime. Wise to start from where it all started. 

Its a part of life. A lesson. A mandatory class that makes us a better person and to go through shit to be one on the other hand.

Would like to take this narrative from my perspective and the way I've grown and become not a perfect but better as a  person myself at present. 

Better in terms of self care, self love, a persona. Many refer that transition on thier lives as a comeback or reincarnation. Can't deny that.

> Every one of you should have a comeback on their life. Wishing a all the best to you!
> You are not alone! 
> Way to go king ðŸ¤´ you got this!

#### Early days

As same as most of our childhood. Life was simple. 

-- Had two people to raise, all you needed is grow old. 
-- Had people to provide for you, all you had to spend and enjoy the treats
-- Had people to give you education to their best of their knowledge, all you had to study
-- Had people to feed you, all you had to eat
-- Had people to buy you clothes and groom you, all you had to flex with your parents entitlement 
-- Had people to put you under a shelter, all you had to rest 

If this isn't luxury, what is then?

You didn't care about this that mandatorily matter now.

Having all these luxury!
You were in the best possible self to ever exist. 

You are / were loved,
By your parents
By your grandparents 
By your relatives 
By your neighbors
By your teachers
By your friends
By most of them you get to meet.

You got a family name that get you carried. Respected. 

The comparison that get to happen by your parents between you and the rest of the town. Sons and daughters of Family friend's, colleagues, relatives, my classmates and whoelse.

Which kid achieves the best in whatwver they compete. The rankings, academics, sports, extra curricular activities like music, arts, general knowledge, dance, combat programmes. Anything. 

Makes the parents proud of your achievements. Parents gets convinced that they're raising the exceptional outstanding kid.

Ngl and can't complain! As same as the majority of the parents, they provide the best to their knowledge in terms of everything that has to be provided for a kid to raise good. It was soo much more for a working class parents to comprehend. WILL AND YALL SHOULD FOREVER GRATEFUL. 

Did it all even if they were all out of their league and capabilities. I wholeheartedly understand how bad it feels that they could not be able provide for their kid. They did their best. THEY ARE THE BEST!!
