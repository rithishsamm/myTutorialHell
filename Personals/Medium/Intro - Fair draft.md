Hello people! 

Finally!! Not for you, but for me. I've been making excuses and, after a long period of time, procrastinating the same, but I've finally hit the screen to type it all out. So, Here I am!!

I'm thrilled to embark on this blogging journey with you. I'm so excited to have you on my page and offer you some good reads to the best of my knowledge!

Forgive me, and do not get offended. I don't follow any standards to comply in terms of writing or blogging.  I don't know any of those. I have no style. I'll be just typing it all, like texting a message, and sending it to be double-checked.

### What to expect
Expect nothing but pure yapping about my personal experiences, perspectives and perceptions. I'll be throwing all of them here to get it all off of my chest and do whatever you want with it!. 

I appreciate you stopping by, taking your time, and surfing through each of my episodes. Love you. I meant it! Your consideration to check my sh*t means a lot. I hope to deliver the best and not disappoint. 

### $whoami
Small intro. Myself Rithish. a 24-year-old passionate individual. I grew up in a city named Chennai. Born in a remote town named Namakkal,. 

I am currently working as a DevOps engineer at a small-scale startup with three years of experience in the IT industry. 

Architecting digital twin, GIS, AI/ML, 3D, Game and simulation-based systems. Sorry for not dropping names; i signed a bunch of NDAs :)

As you can assume or presume (or have no idea), I have been religiously following all things tech and the business around it over in India, obviously Silicon Valley, YC, and beyond.

Will give the gist of my work :)

I started off my career as a recruiter for a consulting company. I gained nothing but industry knowledge and studied all things tech, IT, existing tools, and tech relevant to applications, various sectors, industries, and more.

Later! IDK if, by God's grace or my skills that I've been messing with when I was in lockdown or I've been lucky enough to land one, IRDK! But a very good transition moving from non-IT to IT that I've thought was going to be a heck of a pain and a weight of a hassle. I'm grateful I have a platform.

With a little backstory (saving it for later posts), I got a job as a cloud engineer at a medium scale services company. 

After all the manifestations, I grinded hard, worked harder, gained enough knowledge, and earned 2x AWS certifications (Cloud Practitioner -AWS CLF-CO2, Solutions Architect Associate -AWS SAA-C03). 
+
That's where i started to study it all with no stop sign. STILL DOING. NEVER ENDS. THE NATURE OF WORK THAT I CANT HELP IT. and that's the beauty of it!  
 
After hitting a saturation point, Not a saturation point, but a reality check: if i had to grow more, i should know more about all the substance. In short, should know how software works (SDLC), devops, project management, systems, automation, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, configuration management, security and a  wider range of tools and technologies. so much more.

I got stuck with the work that I've been doing, which was mostly support, operational level but nothing intense, challenging, technical and touched nothing that I've mentioned above. 

Currently, the advantage that i got was that, had all the prerequisite to take off with the same. But didn't want to:)

Not much of a twist but I had a soft spot for programming. 
I always wanted to become a developer. 
I always wanted to build software (make products)
Mastering web development requires a solid foundation in design principles, user experience, and practical coding skills. 
Pain with pleasure. Starting off will be bumpy ride. I wasn't even ready for such a responsibility but still couldn't resist. 

I just didn't care. I had enough savings to sustain for like 3months, quit the job. tried enough but the stakes are high and failed most of the attempts. High expectations that i didn't meet the standards. as previously mentioned, studies continued. Everything came in handy. 

Got a call for a developer role, same result. Didn't meet their expectations so i was considered for another role. Obviously, a DevOps Engineer. Performed the possible worst since i f'd the previous one that i thought I'd lost this, but IDK if it is God's grace or their generosity. but aced it.

after 3 months in probation, currently a devops engineer at a small-scale startup. trying to be sound less and not to describe much since I'm starting off. Just keeping my voice down :) I will cover that all in future.

*That's my career path so far!*

Also seeking some unconventional options to explore and mess with the same. One is this! Content creation. I could use your help by supporting my work. Do follow and subscribe to my updates. And stick with me in the coming days.

My belief and my core strength are that I'd describe myself as a grit. I strongly believe early adoption and first-mover advantage. a doer. Life long learner. an optimistic, passionate individual. I dig deeper into things until it makes sense. rigorously does R&D if anything interests me. I put myself between instincts or emotional beliefs and both radical and logical thinking.

But my interests don't stop there. Beyond the confines of the tech realm, I find joy and inspiration in a wider range of spaces. I religiously follow and keep up with bunch of areas. Covers both technical aspects and, parallelly, its businesses. (as i mentioned) On the tech or science side: software development, devops, SRE, cloud, SaaS, security, hardware, electronics, embedded systems, IoT, robotics, defense tech, drones. aerospace, astronomy, and much more. In the art and business side of it: entrepreneurship, consulting, venture capital, investing, PE, creator economy, podcasting, content creation, (funny what I'm doing rn), social work, philanthropy, and such.

In pursuit of long-term learning, I chase all my areas of interest, quench my cautious multipotentialite thirst (meaning: having multiple interests), and also not make any excuses for the things that I'd want to do. 

#### What is it all about?
I've been admiring the ever-evolving world of technology, software development, and the fascinating intersections of STEM.

I will be covering things in all my areas of interest and expertise that I've previously mentioned. Plus, if time permits, I will do the same with podcasts, or possibly on YouTube, covering it all with a mix of all of my personal experiences, a journey through, and a lot more.

> Another disclaimer: I will not be proficient but will deliver to the best of my knowledge; a mix of my perspective and my flow of narrative will be applied to the same.

These passions fuel my curiosity and shape my view of the world around me. Justification for what and how my content will be all about.

#### End Goal
I look forward to building an organic, relevant audience, genuine relationships with the people that I admire, learning from the people who took unconventional career paths, seasoned individuals, pioneers, masters at their work, learning and growing from them, becoming an insider, and what not! 

In the near future, as in content, I'd like to make business and lifestyle content covering groups or individuals who are all the masters at their work by interviewing and having conversations with them. I've been heavily inspired by some of the amazing individuals, creators, and podcasters such as Lex Friedman, Rogan's. Huberman's, J Calacanis's All-in, Justin Kan, Harry Stebbings, Aarthi and Sriram's show, and a lot lot more. 

As in career, I have a decent idea of where I might end up. Default, I'm gonna master all my technical skills from development to deployment and CAN'T TELL. Mostly a traditional career ladder. That was my plan. IDK.

More time and patience needed. I do have others on plan in parallel where I am doing all these side quests.  All in for worthy experiments and taking risks in this by putting it all at stake. Open for opportunities, whatever interests me.  Finance, Investing, Entrepreneurship, Research, Content creation, Whatever. 

Since I've been following all these amazing individual, I end up aspiring to become like them at some point.  Solopreneurs, General Partners at Big VCs. Renowned founders and CEOs. I don't know, I'm tripping. 

Time tells. Will see how it goes :)


#### Objective 
Through this blog, I aim to share insights, experiences, and discoveries from my diverse interests. By diving into the things that will be covered throughout the journey, I want to create a space where we can engage in thought-provoking discussions and exchange ideas.

But more than just sharing thoughts, my objective is to foster a community of like-minded individuals who are as passionate about the same things mentioned above. 

Together, we can learn, grow, and inspire each other to push the boundaries of what's possible.

So that, 
To cover more and go through the journey, I will gratefully obtain what these are going to offer. 

So, whether you're an enthusiast or simply someone with a curious mind, I invite you to hop on this journey. Let's explore, create, and connect as we navigate through the exciting intersections of our interests.

Stay tuned for my drops, and let's do whatever!

I appreciate your effort. Many thanks!

 Till next time,
 Rithish
