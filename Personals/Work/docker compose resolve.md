Let's first examine the `compose.yaml` file to ensure it correctly specifies the ports for both TCP and UDP. I'll review the uploaded file and compare it with the expected configuration.

### Contents of the Uploaded `compose.yaml`

I'll read and display the contents of the newly uploaded `compose.yaml` file.

It looks like there was an issue reading the contents of the `compose.yaml` file. Let me try again to ensure we can analyze its contents correctly.

Since there is an issue with reading the `compose.yaml` file directly, let's manually check the configuration based on the provided context and the image. The issue seems to be related to UDP port forwarding not functioning as expected.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure UDP port forwarding works properly:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Verify Docker Compose Configuration**:
   Ensure that the `compose.yaml` file has the correct format and syntax for specifying both TCP and UDP ports.

   Example `compose.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     frontend:
       build:
         context: frontend
         target: development
       ports:
         - "17780:3000/tcp"
         - "17780:3000/udp"
       stdin_open: true
       volumes:
         - ./frontend:/usr/src/app
         - /usr/src/app/node_modules
       restart: always
       networks:
         - react-express
       depends_on:
         - backend
       env_file:
         - .env

     # Other services like backend, mongo, etc.

   networks:
     react-express:
       driver: bridge
     express-mongo:
       driver: bridge

   volumes:
     mongo_data:
   ```

2. **Check Docker Version**:
   Ensure that you are using a version of Docker and Docker Compose that supports specifying both TCP and UDP ports. You can check your versions with the following commands:

   ```sh
   docker --version
   docker-compose --version
   ```

   Update if necessary.

3. **Rebuild and Restart Services**:
   Sometimes changes to the `compose.yaml` file require rebuilding and restarting the services. Use the following commands to do so:

   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Verify Port Bindings**:
   After bringing up the services, verify that the ports are correctly bound for both TCP and UDP. You can use the `docker ps` command to list running containers and their port mappings.

   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```

   Additionally, you can inspect the specific container to see detailed port mappings:

   ```sh
   docker inspect <container_id>
   ```

5. **Firewall and Network Configuration**:
   Ensure that your host machine’s firewall and network configuration allow traffic on the specified ports and protocols (both TCP and UDP).

6. **Testing UDP Connection:**
   **To test UDP connectivity, you can use tools like `netcat` (nc) on both the client and server sides.**

   - **Server:**

     ```sh
     nc -u -l 17780
     ```

   - **Client:**

     ```sh
     echo "test message" | nc -u <host_ip> 17780
     ```

   **This will help verify that UDP traffic is correctly routed.**

### Example .env File

Ensure that your `.env` file is correctly placed and populated:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
REACT_APP_ASSET_SERVER=192.168.0.133:8080
REACT_APP_SOCKET_SERVER=192.168.0.110:4000
REACT_APP_IOT_SERVER=192.168.0.133:9000
REACT_APP_LISTASSET_SERVER=192.168.16.3/20:4000
REACT_APP_USER_SERVER=192.168.16.3/20:3500
REACT_APP_MKK_SERVER=192.168.0.137:3000
REACT_APP_ORGANIZATION_SERVER=192.168.16.3/20:5050
REACT_APP_MONGO=mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/
```

If these steps do not resolve the issue, please provide any specific error messages or logs you encounter during the process. This will help diagnose the problem more accurately.
