During that period, I was the sole breadwinner of my family and had to prioritize urgent financial responsibilities, including covering my family’s medical expenses due to COVID-19, supporting my brother’s undergraduate education, and managing household costs. These circumstances made it impossible for me to fulfill my financial commitment to the university, despite my deep desire to complete my degree.

However, over the years, I have worked diligently to establish a stable career as a DevOps Engineer in the IT industry. Now that I am in a better financial position, I am eager to complete my degree and formally obtain my qualification. I understand the inconvenience my situation may have caused to the university administration, and I deeply regret any disruption this may have caused.

With utmost humility, I request the university’s support and guidance in reinstating my academic records and assisting me in completing the necessary formalities to finish my degree. I am willing to comply with any requirements set forth by the administration to make this possible.

Once again, I sincerely apologize for the past circumstances and express my gratitude for the university’s previous support. I hope to receive your kind consideration and a favorable response to help me fulfill this long-standing academic goal.

Thank you for your time and understanding. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,  
Rithish Sam. M, 18106159,
