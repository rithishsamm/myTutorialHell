During my studies, I had always been committed to excelling academically and making the most of the opportunities provided by [University Name]. However, during the final phase of my program, I faced significant challenges as the sole breadwinner of my family. The financial burden became overwhelming when unexpected expenses arose—my family's battle with COVID-19, my mother's healthcare needs, supporting my brother through his undergraduate education for two years, and managing household expenses amidst rising costs. Despite the generous 50% concession offered by the university management toward my tuition fees—a gesture for which I remain deeply grateful—I found myself torn between prioritizing my family's well-being and fulfilling my academic obligations.  

Regrettably, I made the difficult decision to allocate the available funds to safeguarding my family's health and stability. This meant postponing the payment of my final semester fee, ultimately leading to an incomplete status for my degree. It is a decision I have reflected upon often, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or disappointment this may have caused the esteemed administration and faculty members who supported me throughout my journey.  

In the years since leaving university, I have worked diligently to rebuild my career and establish stability. Today, I am proud to say that I hold a mid-level role as a DevOps Engineer, where I manage technical teams and oversee application infrastructure. Over the past three years, I have gained valuable industry experience while continuing to grow professionally. However, I feel a deep sense of incompleteness without my bachelor's degree—a milestone that represents years of hard work and dedication.  

Now that I am in a position to address the outstanding dues and fulfill all necessary requirements, I kindly seek your guidance on the steps I need to take to complete my degree and obtain my certificate. Please let me know if there are additional formalities, documentation, or payments required from my side. I assure you of my full cooperation and commitment to resolving this matter promptly.  

Once again, I extend my sincerest apologies for the delay and any trouble it may have caused. I am truly grateful for the education and support I received from [University Name], and I wish to honor that foundation by finally completing what I started. Your understanding and assistance in this regard would mean the world to me.  

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response and hope to soon be recognized as an alumnus of [University Name], a title I deeply cherish.  

Warm regards,  
Rithish Sam. M, 18106159,
B.Sc (CS) - VISTAS 2018 - 21
