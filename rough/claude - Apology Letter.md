When I left the university, I was facing severe financial constraints as the sole breadwinner of my family. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our household, resulting in unexpected medical expenses for multiple family members. Additionally, I was supporting my brother's undergraduate education and managing our essential household expenses. These compounding financial responsibilities forced me to make the difficult decision to allocate the funds intended for my tuition toward these pressing family needs.

I deeply regret not communicating my situation more effectively to the university administration at that time. The pressure of supporting my family while attempting to complete my education became overwhelming, and I made the difficult choice to prioritize my family's immediate needs over my academic completion.

In the years since leaving the program, I have established myself as a DevOps Engineer in the information technology sector. This career path has allowed me to achieve financial stability and has reinforced my understanding of the value of completing my degree. I now find myself in a position where I can fulfill my outstanding financial obligations to the university and complete the remaining academic requirements for my degree.

I am respectfully requesting the opportunity to:

1. Settle any outstanding balances from my previous enrollment
2. Re-enroll to complete the necessary courses for graduation
3. Receive guidance on any additional requirements that may have been implemented since my departure

I understand that the university has policies regarding program completion timeframes and outstanding balances. I am prepared to comply with any requirements deemed necessary by the administration to facilitate my return and degree completion.

Thank you for considering my request. I am grateful for the education I received at [University Name] and sincerely hope for the opportunity to finally earn my degree from your esteemed institution.

Sincerely,
Rithish Sam. M, 18106159,
B.Sc (CS) - VISTAS 2018 - 21
