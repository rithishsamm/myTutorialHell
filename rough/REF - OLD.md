Over the past two years, I have been grappling with personal challenges that have hindered my ability to focus on my academic pursuits but on balancing my family responsibilities, being the breadwinner, and also advancing my career. Despite my determination, I found it so challenging to maintain focus on my academic pursuits. This juggling act left me in a crippling financial situation where such uncertainty made it difficult to continue my studies. 

However, I am pleased to inform you that I am navigated, made, and taking myself on a solid career path among these difficulties. Through severe manifestation and dedication, I have been stabilizing my situation while making noticeable strides in my career. I am honored to let you know that I've been in the tech industry for the past three years, now in a position working as a DevOps engineer at a product-based company working with deep tech such as Digital Twin, GIS, AI/ML, and IoT workloads.
 

This newfound stability has provided me with enough confidence and resources necessary to address my academic obligations. I want to assure you that I am committed to rectifying this matter where I am in a position to clear my academic dues and continue my endeavors with renewed vigor.
