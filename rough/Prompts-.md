1) Old - qwen old - Apology Letter
Prompt: Write me an apology letter for my university for not completing my degree due to not being able to pay the last semester fee because of my personal issues, such as spending that fee money on my family's health from covid-19, my brother's undergrad, and household expenses, despite the management having offered me a 50% concession on my college tuition. As the sole breadwinner of my family taking care of all this, I wasn't able to pay up, but now I am looking forward to completing it due to being stable and having made a career in IT as a DevOps Engineer for years. I apologize for the administration and help me to get this done.

2) Revised,
Prompt: Write me an apology letter for my university for not completing my bachelor's in science - computer science degree due to not being able to pay the last semester fee because of my personal issues, such as spending that fee money on my family's health, saving them from covid-19, my mother's healthcare, my brother's undergrad for two years, and household expenses, despite the management having offered me a 50% concession on my college tuition. As the sole breadwinner of my family taking care of all this, I wasn't able to pay up, but now I am looking forward to completing it due to being stable and having made a career in IT, having a mid-level role as a DevOps Engineer managing technical teams and application infrastructure for three years. I apologize to the administration and ask them to guide me in retrieving this degree certificate and getting this process done.
