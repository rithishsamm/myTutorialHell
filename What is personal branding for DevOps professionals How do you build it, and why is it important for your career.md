In today’s competitive tech landscape, you need to be different and stand out from the crowd. You need something that attracts recruiters. Something that makes you memorable.

Hundreds, and sometimes thousands of people apply for every open position. All of them have similar resumes and certifications, and most of them have good GitHub accounts.

So what makes you different from the others?
Here your personal brand becomes your secret weapon.

In this article, we’ll explore what personal branding means for DevOps professionals, why it’s more than just a LinkedIn profile, and how to start building a brand that brings opportunities to your inbox.

## What is personal branding for DevOps professionals?

Personal branding is the act of trying to change how other people see you on purpose.

For example, if you want to position yourself as a Cloud Engineer, you should work on brand yourself as a Cloud Engineer.

Think about:
- What do you stand for?
- What are you known for?
- What makes you different?

I, for example, stand for sharing knowledge and help each other. I am known as a CI/CD and automation expert, and [my story](https://medium.com/devops-mindset/my-path-to-devops-why-did-i-choose-devops-as-a-career-264de1f7b396) and my articles are what make me different.

So I have two main goals in terms of personal branding:
- Provide value to my audience.
- Align my account this way so that those who find me on LinkedIn or Medium immediately understand what I do.
In the next sections, I will talk about how I do that.

## Why is personal branding important for DevOps professionals?

Here are a few reasons why you should build your personal brand:
- With a strong brand, people will reach out to you for roles, partnerships, mentoring, assistance, etc.
- Sharing knowledge builds credibility. When you help others to solve problems, you’re seen as a leader.
- You got an extra point in the eyes of potential employers against the others.
- A personal brand helps you to build your own circle of engineers, recruiters, and tech leaders.

## How to build your personal brand

**1. Clarify your core message.**
- What do you want to be known for?
- Who are you trying to help?
- What are you passionate about?

For example:
- I want to be known as a CI/CD and automation expert.
- I’m assisting juniors in their DevOps journey.
- I’m passionate about creating CI/CD pipelines from scratch and bringing changes to organizations.

**2. Optimize your online accounts.**
- **LinkedIn:** [Read here how to optimize it](https://medium.com/devops-mindset/how-to-optimize-your-linkedin-devops-account-to-attract-recruiters-and-hiring-managers-cccf460a54b5).
- **GitHub:** Create a good-looking GitHub account, [for example, like this](https://github.com/Akshyansu3479).
- **Build a projects portfolio:** One of the best ways to show off your DevOps skills is to create several projects and include them in your portfolio and GitHub.

I created 3 example projects for the junior DevOps engineers. Feel free to use them:

**Project 1**: [CI/CD for the Python service using GitHub Actions and AWS](https://medium.com/devops-technical-notes-and-manuals/devops-example-project-for-your-resume-198e34d874b4).

**Project 2**: [AWS, Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, GitHub Actions, Nginx, and Kubernetes](https://medium.com/devops-technical-notes-and-manuals/devops-example-project-for-your-resume-db45a77d6607).

**Project 3**: [Version Control Dashboard using Grafana, Jenkins, and PostgreSQL](https://andreybyhalenko.medium.com/devops-example-project-for-your-portfolio-version-control-dashboard-grafana-jenkins-postgresql-db323fc00103).

**3. Write a blog about your professional journey.**

For example, I write on Medium. Most of my articles are about “How to get into DevOps” and some technical articles.

I started to write after two years of being a DevOps engineer.

I’ve noticed that many developers and systems guys want to make the transition to DevOps and are experiencing difficulties. I know it’s challenging because I’ve been exactly in the same place.

I saw that there are many online technical manuals, courses, and bootcamps about DevOps tools, but almost no information on how to prepare for and pass interviews.

So I decided to start writing about it and help others.

The platforms I write on:
- Medium
- LinkedIn
- Weekly Newsletter

You can write about your journey as well. For example, write about challenges you solve, write tutorials, or give career advice. When you find a solution for something, share it with others.

You can share one tip a week, document your learning process, or create case studies from your home projects or DevOps transition challenges.

Join DevOps communities (Discord, Reddit, etc.) Comment on others’ posts with thoughtful takes. You never know who will notice you and what it will lead to.

Don’t just post technical info, show your human side. Add personal stories.

Your personal story is what makes you different.

## Mistakes to avoid
- Avoid positioning yourself too generically. Choose a niche.
- Avoid posting useless comments on others’ posts. Your comments must be valuable.
- Don’t think you need to be an expert to start sharing anything. There is always someone who needs your advice, even the “basic knowledge” in your opinion.

Your personal brand is your DevOps fingerprint. It’s how people remember you, trust you, and want to work with you. Start simple, be consistent, and show off your personality.

Over time, your name will speak for itself — long before you enter the room.

If you like my articles, join my newsletter, and you will receive weekly DevOps tutorials, articles, and tips every Saturday.

As a bonus, you will receive a free step-by-step DevOps CI/CD project, which you can use in your portfolio.
