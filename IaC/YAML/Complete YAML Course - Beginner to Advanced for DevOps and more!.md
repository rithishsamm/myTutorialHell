##### Intro
this is more of an important context to cover in the journey of DevOps where it is going to be used to manage various system and help us get steps further while we work with Docker, K8's, Cloud Integrations and such.

![[YAML1.png]]
Working with YAML files and the agenda:
1) Intro
- what are YAML files 
- how do we work with it
- what are the benefits of it
- compare it with other files like json, xml files 
2) Syntax
3) Properties / Datatypes
4) Tools
##### What is YAML
YAML:
***Abbreviation***: first it was *Yet another markup language*, later it got changed to -> Y**AML AINT MARKUP LANGUAGE**
***History behind it:*** 
Markup language?: e.g: html, what does HTML do? 
->  html is used to  put some data on the web page, put our links and forms over there, put links, forms,  text and all these headings and everything.
html isn't used to like style your particular web page. we use CSS - cascading style sheets for that.

what is the use html then what is it doing? 
-> it's providing child parent relationship. provides DOM 
first header will come, inside the header 
will have lists inside, in the list we are going to have 
bullet points, inside the bullet points we are going to have 
paragraph,  sometimes we have paragraph outside and  we have 
a table over here then
we have a list over here then
we have some bullet points over here
> so this relationship what goes inside what how they are layered this is the use of like markup language, simply **DOM**

![[YAML2.png]]
**Then, why i got changed to YAML AINT MARKUP LANGUAGE?** 
so YAML is a data serialization language it's not programming language we can store like some information in it and data in it and it means YAML ain't markup language

Why it was first known as yet another markup language?  why are they ing now that it's not another markup language?
=> cause,  markup languages are used to store docents. html stores docents.
in YAML, you can also store objects/ data not just docents but objects, data .
this is  why it's known as YAML aint markup language 

**what is it all about?**
-> YAML is a **data format**, not a programming language. (it was used to exchange data)
-> Similar to xml & JSON datatypes. (we use it to  store data and transmit it across system as APIs)
-> A simple han readable language that can be used to represent data. it is used to store some information about some configurations
-> you can store only data, not commands ( other programming languages you can add commands and everything right if this do that you can do that in YAML you can't do it)
-> known as storing of data in like files. in json you store data, in xml use store data. - called as **DATA SERIALIZATION**.

Will see, it stores data but
-- what type of data
-- where is this data coming from 
-- how does it look like
-- how do we store it
-- how do we read it and all
##### Data serialization and deserialization
**Data Serialization**:
> in simple words if you want to represent this object in a file that you can read and code on modify in those files are known as the data serialization

for eg: You have Data Objects. 
**OBJECT (just a data storage unit) =  Code + Data**:
Collection of a set of Data. Object set of students containing roll no, name and marks.

having Students Marks in Android app -> want to share it in a webApp -> you want to pass that on a ML model. **A Standard use case of an API to pass data over systems**. 
![[YAML4.png]]
here, there needs to be some sort of a way to have a particular data that you want to share in just one single format that can be shared everywhere across systems.

the data that is stored in android operating systems might be different than    your websites  it might be different than your machine learning models 

so how do i if i want to share the data stored in android i might need to convert it or whatever is showing to web and then machine learning how will that work??
>the idea is **serialization and deserialization**

**Serialization and Deserialization**:
> Serialization: is basically a process/method of converting the data objects into a complex data structure/ into a stream of byte.
> 
> basically convert the data object in a some complex data structures into a stream of storage that can be used to transfer this data on likes your physical devices.

if you're aware about json data so  in  when you get from an api call you get a json data you convert that into your json objects or whatever. THIS IS WHAT THAT IS.
![[YAML5one.png]]
e.g: 
1) an Object (YAML file + Data) -> Stream (bytestream/chunks of Data) -> Store in DB
//this so far is known as SERIALIZATION.

DB's Data -> Back to Stream -> back to objects
//the reverse of this same, known as DESERILIZATION.

![[YAML5two.png]]
**Serialization:**
in simple language 
1) you may have some object in your memory
2) you put it into like sterilizer kind of a program, doing some serialization on the data
> Serializer, process of converting this data object which is a combination of code and data into series of bytes that saves the state of this object in a form that is easily transmittable.
> Reverse of this is Deserialization.
1) it converts it into a stream of bytes, just memory 
2) now you can store them in your: YAML or DB or Memory

**OBJECT, a combo of Code + Data**
Now, you want to store this particular object. you want to read what is inside the object in a han readable form or /  you want to transfer this object into various other domains / you want to transfer one object to another object / you want to 
transfer it into a database, n a memory, in a file.
->
You pass it into a serializer, 
-> 
Now you can store it all in different medis. (These will make more sense when you work with things like big data and machine learning and stuff. serialization comes into picture)

**SOME OF THE DATA SERIZATION LANGUAGES:**
language used in those files is known as data serialization language.
a language that can be used to represent this data in the text format is data
serialization languages. YAML, json and xml. 

in this way you can use the these languages to represent data in code. you can store data in the format of code 
then you can use that file to convert it into an object that is known as deserialization.

object to file file to object 
object to file - serialization
file to object - deserialization
> [!NOTE] Data Serialization
> so you have one object that is on some computer you want to transfer it into let's  another application so format may be different 
> 
> how do we make sure that this  format is maintained and we can 
wouldn't it be cool to have just one format that i can share everywhere 
 
convert that object into a YAML file - **Serialization**
convert that YAML file back into an object - **Deserialization**
##### What is YAML 
![[YAML7.png]]
representation of your object like in code that way you can see it in YAML file. so
>what type of objects will be stored?
>it's basically used in like configuration files

e.g: for example, so in configuration files kubernetes configuration or in other tools 
whatever you create various objects. 

a deployment in K8's on YAML config files. 
***Deployment Requirements***: i made my application and i want to run my application on 10 servers in the cloud and they should run in such a way that only  at most five applications are running per server or something.
here's the written type of what this object should look like please take it and create the object -> written in the form of **YAML**.you can write it in the form of like  other programming languages  like java python for that we have clients packaging it as SDK's. 
***Kuberenetes:***  i will do that for you. i have this object. here's the written type of what this object should look like please take it and create the object -> written in the form of **YAML**. then it'll make it all as a pod where K8's refers it.

> yaml is used to do that you can store data is a data serialization language.

applied in:
- writing configuration files -> Docker, Kubernetes, Podman and more
- YAML also used in working with logs, Caches, etc.
will see further more with of an example.
##### Benefits of YAML
- Simple, Easy to read and Han Readable
- Strict (***Indentation Matters***) , nice and simple syntax (lower prone to error)
- Easily Convertible between JSON, XML. 
-(you take input in the form of yaml 
you output it in the form of json. 
can be done. very simple)
- Most languages uses YAML.
- Popular
- More powerful when representing complex data
- you you can also use various tools with it. like PARSER etc. Various tools available.
- Third party tools where you can work with YAML Files without even directly working with them - Lens IDE. 
-why? - when we get started with K8's, we work heavily with YAML files more 
writing yaml files again and again it's like really  boring - K8's Lens IDE.
Provides GUI and does the magic. Will see how we can work with that. will make life very easy. 
- Parsing? - Just reading the data. Parsing is easy. So many Parsers available. 
![[YAML3.png]]
Revision: YAML ain't markup language. it's used to  store data and stuff and it's used to so similar to working with formats like xml json.
>yaml is just a way to represent data you can use that to convert it into objects and stuff
##### Demo of YAML file
let's put everything into picture and see a live demo. let's see how it looks like how do we store data and such. work with some basic stuff to use the syntax and like everything i mentioned in the beginning, some tools, will see the syntax and some of the data types and how it compares with json and xml.
```disclaimer
 we're going to be using yaml extensively in the course then don't worry. yaml is not going to leave you.

you will get plenty of opportunities to work with yaml.

this is nothing. main thing iskubernetes.

that is the main thing when we work with devops infrastructures, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and like pipelines and cloud providers, working with cloud computing
and things like that.

so that's the main thing is this is the starting of devops. this is just the tools that we're learning right now. 

WILL MOVE FORWARD :)
```
##### Creating a YAML file
1) open IDE
2) create new file
3) simple extn of YAML file is .yaml or .yml . Both works well.
4) demo -> hello.yaml

-> Will get started from here.

> [!NOTE] YAML RITUAL
> every yaml file's data's gets differentiated with three --- on top of it. for eg:
```YAML
---
//yaml script
//key value dataype
---
//list datatype
---
//block datatype
... /-> means docent finished here
```

will see further in the scripts part that what are all the components(datatypes) available working with the same.
##### Key datatype
You may have dictionaries or hash maps and stuff. similarly,  in yaml's,  
**TYPE1**: we can store such data types like key value pairs.
e.g. To the context of key value pairs, we can have something like, 
```YAML
---
"apple": "a red fruit" 
//apple is key and it has a value of what- a red fruit
1: "rithish's first PID" //this is the key, this the value
```
when we talk about key value pairs, you have a key over here that is going to point to some value like this.

you see how it's represented, you can see that. 
![[YAML8.png]]

this particular thing is not stored in like in hash maps and stuff, it's stored like in HashMap like a memory.

```YAML
---
//key value type
"apple": "a red fruit" 
1: "rithish's first PID"
```
but this is over here just a textual representation.
-> you can use this yaml file and convert a HashMap out of it.
in that case,  this will be the key this will be the value.

you can convert a json object out of it,  pass it into your web development or projects or whatever. That is key value pair.
##### List datatype
some other pairs such as lists. something like if i add some comments over here .
ist so you can add list, something like 
```YAML
---
//list style datatype
- apple
- mango
- banana
```
that's it this is how you represent this using the dash
+one more thing,
>yaml is case sensitive. 
if you add, 
-Apple 
means, that's two different objects.

 so
-Apple, 
these are two different things. so that's a pointer that I'd like to make that yaml is case sensitive. if you're using  in yaml files so if you wanna  mention some some more complex  like data types for example so in that way we can do it. 
##### Block style
block style
so in the blog style , will some such as Cities.
```YAML
---
//block style datatype
cities:
	- new delhi
	- mbai
	- chennai
```
-indentation matters. 
if one single indentation gets mixed. THROWS ERROR.

> my research: if you done something like
> cities:
> - chennai 
> - mbai
> - new delhi
> 
> itll take that as, 
```YAML
---
> cities: -chennai -cbe -salem
```
++
Also there is something known as flow types where you can data in a single line. so that, you don't mess with indentation problems,
the syntax will be like
```YAML
cities: [chennai, mbai, new delhi]
```
IF you messed up anything? you can check them all using something known as **YAML PARSERS**. -> for e.g.
##### Checking YAML syntax (with YAML PARSERS)
https://www.yamllint.com/
validate all your YAML here.

if anything massed up, it days, YOU ARENT MATCHING WITH THE BLOCK.
>Spaces, declaration and indentation are EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
Follow the syntax and the best practices. (like it is in python)
##### Differentiate between docents
saw various datatypes and declaring instructions and such. how should we tell and how does YAML understand the different kinds of docents in various datatypes declared in the YAML file.

e,g: in K8s,   we're creating objects, creating a pod, creating
some replicas, creating some deployments ingress or whatever.

here, you're creating different different objects or you have a simple yaml file that contains various objects representation of one like in previous, 

1) apples in fruit,  in Key Value Datatype
2) list of fruits, in List datatype
3) list of cities, in block datatype
you differentiate each with --- in between each type. 
(as we previously saw.)
+
ending the doent with ... (three dots)
##### How does block style work
```YAML
cities:
	- new delhi
	- mbai
	- chennai
```
for e.g. with this block style,
cities is the block, beneath that, it is pointing to that list.
![[YAML9.png]]
##### Working with JSON file
 see working with JSON files.
There are converters doing YAML to JSON but that is simply.. just placing semi colons.

if it is in YAML as 
```YAML
cities:
  - chennai
  - cbe
  - salem
```
in JSON, it'll be like,
```JSON
{
    "cities": [
        "chennai",
        "cbe",
        "salem"
    ]
}
```
JUST DOUBLE QUOTES, SQUARE BRACKET,  CURLY BRACES AND COMMA'S
##### Storing data in single line
++ you work with flow type
s where you can data in a single line. so that, you don't mess with indentation problems,
the syntax will be like
for BLOCK STYLE DATATYPE, 
```YAML
cities: [chennai, mbai, new delhi]
```
for KEY VALUE PAIR,
```YAML
{apple: "red fruit", shape: round}
```
##### Comments in YAML 
```
# - COMMENTS,
#only single line comments not multilines, jsut hashes again and again.
```
##### Datatypes in YAML 
just like datatypes exist in each language, will see the options in brief here.
every language has some data types such as normal data types,  primitives, complex data types, arrays, hash maps. let's cover that over here.
datatypes.yml
-- variables can be known as various datatypes
1) String variables, # var, colon, space, datatype (plain no quotes, single and double quotes) - three ways to represent string types in YAML.
```YAML
#string variables
myself: Rithish Sam 
fruit: "apple"
job: 'devops'
```
##### Storing data in multiple lines
```YAML
bio: | # | the dash will be of seperate line
 hey my name is kunal kushwaha.
 i am a very nice dude. 

# > - writes single line in multiple lines
message: >
 this will 
 all be 
 in one single line.

# same as
message: !!str this will all be in one single line
```

```JSON
{
  "myself": "Rithish Sam",
  "fruit": "apple",
  "job": "devops",
  "bio": "hey my name is kunal kushwaha.\ni am a very nice dude.\n",
  "message": "this will  all be  in one single line.\n"
}
```
##### Datatypes in YAML 
```YAML
nber: 5473
marks: 98.76
booleanValue: No #booleanValue: !!bool No
# n, N, false, False, FALSE
# same for true -> yes, y, Y
```

```JSON
{
  "nber": 5473,
  "marks": 98.76,
  "booleanValue": "No"
}
```
##### Specifying datatype in YAML(!! in shorthands)
```YAML
---
# specify the datatypes with !! (also known as shorthands)
#!!int - integer
#!!bool - boolean
#!!float - float (decimals)
#!!null = null
#.nan = not a nber
#timestamp = date with Timezones
#arrays - we saw that previously (in block, list and array style)

zero: !!int 0
positiveN: !!int 45
negativeN: !!int -45
binaryN: !!int 0b11001
octalN: !!int 06574
hexa: !!int 0x45
commaValue: !!int +540_000 # 540,000
exponential nbers: 6.023E56 #exponents

# floating point nbers
marks: !!float 56.89
infinite: !!float .inf
not a n: .nan

# null
surname: !!null Null # or null NULL ~
~: this is a null key

# dates and time
date: !!timestamp 2002-12-14
india time: 2001-12-15T02:59:43.10 +5:30
no time zone: 2001-12-15T02:59:43.10
```

```JSON
{
  "zero": 0,
  "positiveN": 45,
  "negativeN": -45,
  "binaryN": 25,
  "octalN": 3452,
  "hexa": 69,
  "commaValue": 540000,
  "exponential nbers": 6.023e+56,
  "marks": 56.89,
  "infinite": null,
  "not a n": null,
  "surname": null,
  "null": "this is a null key",
  "date": "2002-12-14T00:00:00.000Z",
  "india time": "2001-12-14T21:29:43 + 5.30",
  "no time zone": "2001-12-15T02:59:43.100Z"
}
```
##### Advanced datatypes
advancedDatatypes.yml (such as sequence, )
#####  Sequence datatype
```YAML
#!!seq - block in sequence datatype specification

student: !!seq
 - marks
 - name
 - roll_no

# same as
cities: [new delhi, mbai]
```

```JSON
{
  "student": [
    "marks",
    "name",
    "roll_no"
  ],
  "cities": [
    "new delhi",
    "mbai"
  ]
}
```
the following data gets stored like this,
![[YAML9.png]]
##### Sparce Sequence datatype
maybe possible that you have some some fields that are empty. for that, use sparce sequence.
```YAML
#Sparse sequence datatype
# some of the keys of the seq will be empty

sparse seq:
 - hey
 - how
 - 
 - Null
 - sup
```

```JSON
{
  "sparse seq": [
    "hey",
    "how",
    null,
    null,
    "sup"
  ]
}
```
##### Nested sequences
sometimes you may want to represent like sub items of a particular list, for that you can do nested sequences
```YAML
# nested sequence
- 
 - mango
 - apple
 - banana
-
 - marks
 - roll n
 - date
```
in JSON will get a clear idea on this, things are nest one on another
```JSON
[
  [
    "mango",
    "apple",
    "banana"
  ],
  [
    "marks",
    "roll n",
    "date"
  ]
]
```
##### Maps datatype 
```YAML
# key: value pairs are called maps/like hashmaps
#!!map = for key value pair dataype specification

!!map

# nested mappings: map within an map
name: Kunal Kushwaha
role:
  age: 78
  job: student

# same as
name: Kunal Kushwaha
role: { age: 78, job: student}
```
```JSON
{
  "name": "Kunal Kushwaha",
  "role": {
    "age": 78,
    "job": "student"
  }
}
```
##### Pairs datatype
```YAML
# pairs: keys may have duplicate values
# !!pairs = pair dataype specification


pair example: !!pairs
 - job: student
 - job: teacher
#this will be a hash table containing arrays

# same as
pair example: !!pairs [job: student, job: teacher]
# as same that the last, this will be an array of hashtables
```

```JSON
{
  "pair example": [
    [
      "job",
      "student"
    ],
  ]
}
```
##### Set datatype
No key value pairs, just items and items only.
```YAML
# !!set will allow you to have unique values
#eg: only unique names needed, so will convert it into a set.
#cant have multiple names here like two kunals cant exist
#i did not provide any value only keys and stuff are provided over here 

names: !!set
 ? Kunal
 ? Apoorv
 ? Rahul
```

```JSON
{
  "names": {
    "Kunal": null,
    "Apoorv": null,
    "Rahul": null
  }
}
```
##### Dictionary datatype
you may want to have a particular key and the value to be like a sequence. the sequences this entire sequence should be represented as a value. in that case you can use dictionary. 
dictionary datatype specification - omap
```YAML
# dictionary = !!omap
people: !!omap
  - Kunal:
     name: Kunal Kushwaha
     age: 78
     height: 678
  - Rahul:
     name: Rahul OP
     age: 50
     height: 456
#indentation matters to represent parent and child
```

```JSON
{
  "people": [
    {
      "Kunal": {
        "name": "Kunal Kushwaha",
        "age": 78,
        "height": 678
      }
    },
    {
      "Rahul": {
        "name": "Rahul OP",
        "age": 50,
        "height": 456
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
gets represented like, 
![[YAML11.png]]
##### Reusing properties with anchors
reusing some properties. 
will add something like a person and some information i can add about them,  or let's  just the likings of a person. let's  favorite fruit of a person = mango and dislike of this person =  grapes or something 

now creating a person, kunal
for example: 
so you just ing person  and you're ing name is equal to let's  there are five people whose favorite fruit is mango and favorite dislikes dislikes are grapes. 
what are you going to do? - copy paste for each person again and again
this is getting repetitive. 
```YAML
liking:
	fav fruit: mango
	dislikes: grapes

person1:
	name: Rithish
	fav fruit: mango
	dislikes: grapes

person2:
	name: Arun
	fav fruit: mango
	dislikes: grapes

person3:
	name: Monish
	fav fruit: mango
	dislikes: grapes
```
 this code these two lines are getting repetitive if you have to insert a thousand people who have this same property you will write these two lines thousand times.
But is it a good practice? - No.

solutions? - use Anchor tags. &base is the property that you want to copy and declare wherever you'd like to paste it with <<.


what do we use we use anchors so basically anchors mean that what is the property you want to use = &base(strings as per convenience).
base is the command for this.

 so for example,  we want to copy a property. so we will give our anchor a name. 
```
property: &base
 values: 1
 values: 2

subproperty:
	<<: *base
```
 for base and 
 <<: * base
 
this symbol << basically s that  the maps that i'm specifying as the value which is &base as &propName should be inserted here.
+
you can also override it.
let's  you want to overwrite the dislikes of rahul 
```YAML
person2:
	name: monish
	<<: *likes
	dislike: berries #dilieks gets overridden with given value
```

```YAML
#THAT WILL LOOK LIKE
person2:
	name: monish
	fav fruit: mango
	dislike: berries
```
->  so these are anchor tags 

=> Full representation of anchor tags
```YML
# reusing some properties using anchors
likings: &likes #&base
  fav fruit: mango
  dislikes: grapes

person1:
  name: Kunal Kushwaha
  <<: *likes

person2:
  name: Rahul
  <<: *likes
  dislikes: berries

# this will look like
person2:
  name: Rahul
  fav fruit: mango
  dislikes: berries

person3:
  name: Apoorv
  fav fruit: mango #or call the anchor base tag
  dislikes: grapes 
```

```JSON
{
  "likings": {
    "fav fruit": "mango",
    "dislikes": "grapes"
  },
  "person1": {
    "name": "Kunal Kushwaha",
    "fav fruit": "mango",
    "dislikes": "grapes"
  },
  "person2": { #x2, duplicate error
    "name": "Rahul",
    "fav fruit": "mango",
    "dislikes": "berries"
  },
  "person3": {
    "name": "Apoorv",
    "fav fruit": "mango",
    "dislikes": "grapes"
  }
}
```
##### Real world examples
that was basically about all the types and everything that we wanted to cover.

let's take a real world example,
##### Storing data in XML
let's  you want to define a particular data of some object. 
like students, we knwo how it's stored in yaml. 
will see how we can define it how data is stored in xml, json. 

will try to store one simple main data is like  there's a school for example - 
1) school and 
2) has a particular like name is available for the school and 
3) there is the principal of the school and 
4) you have a list of all the students. 
5) every single student  
- has a role nber
- and a name
- and marks.
![[YAML10.png]]
we want to represent this in the form of your yaml file or xml file or json file.
this is a data and we have to store it in the form of a code with the help all the datatypes that we can structure it with. how?
> serialization and deserialization 

-- that is what we're going to be doing over here. let's see how we can do that.
1) create a file over here 
2) eg.xml 
> xml stands for extensible markup language

 it's also used to store data, can be used to share data across various platforms, used in various various systems and like back-end systems and more. so

school.xml
> Not so han readable if gets larger in size and the complex it gets.
```xml
#should provide versions + the character encoding that supports the communication inbetween.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<School name="DPS" principal="Someone">
    <Students>
        <Student>
            <rno>23</rno>
            <name>"Kunal"</name>
            <marks>94</marks>
        </Student>
    </Students>
</School>
```

```YAML
---
School:
- name: DPS
  pricipal: Someone
  Students:
  - rno: 12
    name: Kunal Kuswaha
    marks: 67
```
this how you represent the same in XML form. 
so this is not like really han readable or whatever but still people and many many companies do use that.
##### Storing (the same) data in JSON
the next version, we can look into is what json 
json 
- is pretty popular 
- json it stands for javascript object notation 
- heavily used in javascript and 
- one of the most popular serialization formats that people use 
- there are like data types like json data types these are objects

  in mongodb and stuff ,we use like json objects over there.
 if you want to write this in a code format you can use json for that.
 
-> create school.json
it starts with curly braces and everything goes inside curly braces.
- i'm gonna have my school and 
- school is gonna have a few properties all these three properties will go inside this list area + those properties that will get inside the curly brace too.
- first property is what name of the school name= dps,
- second property, principle = someone 
- third property, contains values and that gets represented in [].

so we have students can be multiple so array list 
and now a single student you want to add another student you can add like this another student  so this is the represent difference between square brackets and curly braces this represents a collection this represents one entity you want to add another school you can add it and  i can add what role nber name and marks

 you cannot add nbers as a key over here strings are added  so this is how you write it in xml.
```JSON
{
    "School": [
        {
            "name": "DPS",
            "pricipal": "Someone",
            "Students": [
                {
                    "rno": 12,
                    "name": "Kunal Kuswaha",
                    "marks":67
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```

```YAML
---
School:
  - name: DPS
    pricipal: Someone
    Students:
      - rno: 12
        name: Kunal Kuswaha
        marks: 67
```
 TO ADD ANOTHER SCOOL, DO THE SAME WITH A CURLY BRACES AND FOLLOW ALONG.
##### YAML DevOps tools
Tools we saw already:
yamllint.com
and more.
![[YAMLl.png]]
>IMPORTANT:
these things will give error and stuff if we give these things done  
manually or some.
>But When we get to work with K8s and such. big big large large files
>**you have to make sure that your yaml files are basically validated**

some amazing devops tools that are going to help you when working with
or without like yaml files and even like remotely working with it

1) if you want to like check whether your yaml files are correct or not,
https://itnext.io/how-to-validate-kubernetes-yaml-files-9a17b9a30f08
-> this is a great blog on you how to validate your YAML files. here's everything is basically mentioned how you can work with schemas and everything.
##### Datree
the first tool is a **DATREE** 
>it's validates your k8's a configuration files and those are also in yaml only and it also validates your yaml files. 

to see the structure of your yaml file is it right or not. 
basically when we cover kubernetes for examples, you can use data to validate your YAML files. + run the yaml validation checks and K8's schema checks and everything.

this is going to be extremely handy if you work with K8's. you'll be able to check your yaml files like just one more line of commands
##### Monokle (by Kubeshop)
when you work with kubernetes yaml files they are extremely like  big and stuff and complex so you can check out monocle by kubeshop. 

so if you check out monocle by cube shop 
>all these yaml files and everything you see over here right dot.yaml. yaml files it makes it easy for you to see in a navigation format.   so it basically makes us easier makes it easier for us to work with these large-scale yaml files, the kubernetes manifest files  so it will help you in managing your kubernetes manifest , kubernetes yaml files 

and there's monocle there's cusk and this test cube  but step by step. 
we'll be learning a lot of other things.
##### Lens
Lens. this is amazing 
so in kubernetes as i mentioned you want to try out something you want to create new pods or any any new objects you have to write big big yaml files and deploy those. 

lens on the other hand what does is, it does all these things for us. using the app with GUI.

you want to create any pods or something.  you wanna check out this pod.
you want to create another another resource. i want to create another deployment. Voila! -> Creates all the resources in YAML.

>It created the yaml file for me. automatically if you were not using lens and you wanted to create a deployment or something you had to write this on your own

obviously we will learn how to write this on our own.
>but when you are practicing and when you are working in production and stuff  to save time tools like lens are amazing world's most advanced kubernetes platform. 

you can download it right now and basically you're working with kubernetes without working with yaml files so it's more developer focused and stuff and you can check out all the information about your cluster of cpu and memory usage and more.
##### Outro
all good!
