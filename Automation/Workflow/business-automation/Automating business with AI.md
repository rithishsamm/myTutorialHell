#### 1) Automating Development - ?(none)

#### 2) Automating Operations
Such a headache due to identifying events in the first place and automating the same secondly
such as,
1. Events
2. Follow-up
3. Scheduling
4. Reminding such scheduling
5. Client Follow-ups on sales and payments
6. Updates
7. Task Reports
8. Task assigning
Idea behind automating all these is, 

-> Personal Assistant, who can be able to 
- manage tasks
- able to text to all the teammates regarding specific event
- Assigning tasks to teammates if the schedule is busy (by messaging)
- Update follow-ups on time
- Group message to outreach - (triggers sending company's profile if anyone reaches out in groups regarding services querying clients)
- Managing daily tasks (daily reminder)
- Managing projects 

###### 3) Automating Marketing
Type of three:
- **Inbound Marketing**
- **Outbound Marketing**
- **Content Creation and Publishing**

##### 1) **Inbound Marketing**
**Structure of Inbound:**
>Website -> Contact Form -> Prospect enquiring for services -> With their Name, Phone Number, Email and Message -> Agent

1- Ok -> Schedule a meeting
2- If ghosted, Alternatively, An agent Researching Prospect's LinkedIn -> Cold email/ LinkedIn Text -> Schedule a meeting 
- Prospect Research
- Cold Call prospect and book meet based on client's availability
- Cold Email and Follow-up
- LinkedIn outreach to the prospect


##### 2) **Outbound Marketing** (!IMP)

##### 3) **Content Creation and Publishing****
Content can go agentic into two parts:
**Blog Content creation and publishing**

- Automated publishing
Blogs for organizations -> Transforming that blog into -> 2 LinkedIn Blog Posts/repurposing it by making it into two twitter threads.

**Repurposing existing Content and publishing**

- Automated publishing on multiple platforms. 

To achieve this:
1) **Blog Content creation and publishing Agent**
To create Blog Posts: Steps to create such agent is:

- After Research -> Copyediting that Blog Script (Fine Tuning, non AI)
- More tuning to be SEO + GEO optimized
- Auto publishing on WordPress

2) **Repurposing existing Content and publishing**

###### 4) Automating Sales:
Agentic Sales Pipeline are of two types:
1) **Pre-sales**
- Automatic Questionaries
- Research About client after querying data
- Customized sales proposal with quotation and example
- Sales script

Process: If a clients comes under the pipeline means 
- -> Sending a Questionnaire form regarding all their basic information + service requirement such as
- -> (service type, number of pages or posts pm/ budget/ references/ preferences/ more info) + company research 
- -> after fetching those information 
- -> sending a proposal based on that information and scheduling a meeting
Doing all this with agent - workflow follows as, (*all these without any human intervention*)
- **Automated Questionnaire** delivered to prospect -> after query
- **Research based on query** - on web and other socials
- Creating Business/**Sales proposal** - including references, budget and quotation - based on that information
- **Sales script** in the meeting to pitch in - automated based out that workflow.  

2) **Post-sales* - ?
