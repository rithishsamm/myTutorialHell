This is a documentation on K3s, a Lightweight Kubernetes. Easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary of less than 100 MB. Good for very minimal workloads. 

==The term K3s came because of the installation of Kubernetes that was half the size in terms of memory footprint. Kubernetes is a 10-letter word stylized as K8s. So something half as big as Kubernetes would be a 5-letter word stylized as K3s. There is no long form of K3s and no official pronunciation.==

This script is available at [https://get.k3s.io](https://get.k3s.io/). To install K3s using this method, just run:
