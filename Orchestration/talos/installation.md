Great â€” you're on the right track! Since youâ€™re running Talos Linux in a VirtualBox VM and using Ubuntu Desktop as your host, you can absolutely run `talosctl` on your host and connect to the VM. Here's a step-by-step guide:

---

## âœ… Step-by-Step: Connect `talosctl` to a Talos VM on VirtualBox

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Install `talosctl` on Your Ubuntu Host**

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://talos.dev/install | sh
```

Then move it to your path if needed:

```bash
sudo install -m 755 bin/talosctl /usr/local/bin/talosctl
```

Confirm it's installed:

```bash
talosctl version
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Download a Talos Machine Configuration**

Generate config files for Talos nodes (control plane and/or worker):

```bash
talosctl gen config my-cluster https://<VM-IP>:6443
```

- Replace `<VM-IP>` with the **VirtualBox VM's IP address** (e.g., 192.168.56.101).
    
- You can also use a dummy IP here â€” you'll apply real IPs later.
    

This will generate:

- `controlplane.yaml`
    
- `worker.yaml`
    
- `talosconfig` (your `talosctl` config file)
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Set Up Networking in VirtualBox**

Make sure the VM has networking that allows your Ubuntu host to talk to it. There are two common setups:

#### Option A: Host-Only Network (Recommended for testing)

- In VirtualBox, go to **Settings â†’ Network â†’ Adapter 2**.
    
- Enable it and choose **Host-only Adapter**.
    
- Start the VM and check its IP address using the Talos console (`Ctrl+Alt+F1` if needed).
    
- It should be something like `192.168.56.x`.
    

#### Option B: NAT with Port Forwarding

- Use NAT for Adapter 1 and forward ports (e.g., 50000â€“50010) for Talos traffic.
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Apply Talos Config to the VM**

From your host machine:

```bash
talosctl apply-config --insecure \
  --nodes <VM-IP> \
  --file controlplane.yaml
```

Use the VMâ€™s IP as seen in step 3.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Bootstrap the Cluster (for control plane only)**

Only for the **first control plane node**:

```bash
talosctl bootstrap --nodes <VM-IP>
```

This initializes the Kubernetes control plane.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Get kubeconfig**

To get your `kubeconfig` so you can use `kubectl`:

```bash
talosctl kubeconfig . --nodes <VM-IP>
```

Then you can do:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

---

### ðŸ§  Notes

- Talos will **not respond to pings or SSH**, which is normal.
    
- All interaction is via `talosctl` using the IP and gRPC ports.
    
- Default ports: Talos uses port **50000** for the API.
    
    - You may need to forward this port from VirtualBox if using NAT.
        

---

If youâ€™re unsure of the IP your Talos VM has been assigned, let me know how you configured networking in VirtualBox, and I can help you find it or adjust the setup.

Would you like to start by confirming the VMâ€™s IP and networking setup first?
