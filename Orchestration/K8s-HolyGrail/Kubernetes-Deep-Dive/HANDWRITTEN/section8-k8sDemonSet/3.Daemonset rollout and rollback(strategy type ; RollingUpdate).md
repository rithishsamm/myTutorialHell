# 3.  DaemonSet rollout and rollback(strategy type: RollingUpdate)

DaemonSet rollout and rollback(strategy type: Rolling Update)

Will cover all the **RollingStrategies** available for the `ds` object.

If we inspect the `ds`,
```sh
kubectl get ds dsName -o yaml
kubectl get ds dsName -o yaml | grep update
```

It shows all the details in the `yaml` format, there will be *UpdateStrategy* `StrategyType`=`RollingUpdate` which gets applied by default despite mentioning and declaring the same in the manifest. 

###### Rollout
 For the versions of `ds`, we do have the `revisions` for the same as same as the other `rollback`, `rollout` objects too. To check the list of revisions:
```sh
kubectl rollout history ds/dsName
```
TO review a specific revision, do this to print the PodTemplate,
```sh
kubectl rollout history ds dsName --revision=n 
```

Will perform an upgrade and have a revision for it,
```sh
kubectl get ds,po -o wide
kubectl set image ds dsName containerName=image:versionTag
```
and check and verify the same by
```sh
kubectl rollout status ds dsName
```
```sh
curl -I IP
```

> THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS UPDATE, here is a bit different. It creates the NEW one no matter what, after completion of the NEW POD and deletes the old . **==One by one, one node at a time==** 
-Regardless of balancing **max unavailable** and **surge**. 

acts differently for `deploy` and for `ds`.

ALL THE PODS ARE UPDATED IN ALL THE DIFFERENT NODES. 

###### Rollback
To get back/restore a revision means, 
To check the list of revisions:
```sh
kubectl rollout history ds/dsName
```
TO review a specific revision, do this to print the PodTemplate,
```sh
kubectl rollout history ds dsName --revision=n 
```
and check and verify the same by
```sh
kubectl rollout status ds dsName
```
```sh
curl -I IP
```

**To rollback one version back:**
```sh
kubectl rollout undo ds/dsName
```
**To rollout to a specific version:**
```sh
