9. POD multi-container with shared volume
###### Multi-container pod with Shared Volume - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F5.Multicontainer%20pod%20with%20Shared%20Volume.docx)

SPINNING MULTIPLE CONTAINERS IN A POD + WILL SEE THE SAME SHARED VOLUME WITH IT. SAME AS BEFORE SPINNING A SINGLE CONTAINER IN A POD BUT HERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE BUT XTRA VOLUME FOLDERS.

Will see a pictorial view:
![[Pasted image 20240830105402.png]]
Here is the Node Where our Pods have been launched. More probably the **Worker Node**. Except single-node setup if not. Will take the worker node as we are doing it. So, here for instance, what we have is,

Worker node -> Pod -> two-containers: 1) `nginx`, 2) `alpine`
- ==**As a user, if you want to access the POD. You will be ping or reaching out to the IP of the POD, not the containers.** ==. Now, 
- ==Here, The POD will be resolving the IP address and redirecting that request to the relevant Container.==
1) here, it gets routed to `nginx` since it is a web server and runs on port 80 serving data to the end-user.
 2) and what about `alpine` container. no application. just a system to run specific jobs. Here, it writes/produces data from a specific working directory, for example. `/var/tmp/index.html`
 Will see how that rolls out.
 - Here, whatever **data** that gets produced in the `/var/tmp/index.html`, will mount it to the Shared volume of that POD. 
**`/var/lib/kubelet/"uid"/volumes/emptydir/containerVolumes`**
- Now, the container's Volume `/var/share/nginx/html` is also  mounted to the Shared volume of that POD as well.
> **==which means, whatever pops in that Volume can be accessed in between the container as well.==**

So, `alpine` image is writing the data here in `/var/tmp/index.html`
-> 
that directory has been mounted to the same shared POD volume in
**`/var/lib/kubelet/"uid"/volumes/emptydir/containerVolumes`**`
-> 
which is also mounted to the `nginx` container to serve the data since the volume of that container `/var/share/nginx/html` is shared with PODs Shared Volume too.


**==MULTIPLE CONTAINERS CAN SHARE THE VOLUME TO SERVE THE DATA!==**

**Will see this in practice by applying the logic of launching an application that one container produces the data -> shares the same in POD volume 
-> which spawns into container which serves the data.**

***
	*We have a node. Inside that,*
	*Node --> Pod with an IP (with two containers)--> nginx + alpine } ->* 
> 	*If we got to access the container, no container IP can be resolved since each of the container can be communicated, only via the POD IP alone. Inside that IP, both can talk to each other only on its own `locahost`s or `127.0.0.1`.* 
	*==req -> PodIP -> nginxport80 + alpine22 -> container's data lands on its own volumes -> which will be stored also in the `volumemount` under systems.==*
	*e.g.: here, we have a pod with two containers. one nginx which serves data, one alpine which writes data. each `workdir` gets mounted on system's volume mount.*
	*- nginx port80-> /usr/share/nginx/html -> /var/lib/kubelet/podUID/volumes*
	*- alpine port80-> /var/tmp/`whateverdata` -> /var/lib/kubelet/podUID/volumes*
	*=> based on this logic, will deploy an application works this way which helps and used in many cases. POD with multi-container.*
	***Moral: A single storage volume can be stored and serve data to multiple containers. Just like other infra models such as VMs and On-prems. Same logic can be applied to multi-container pod***
***

Will see that in practice. 
**`multicontainer-pod.yaml`** 
>==**Note: without defining apiVersion, rest of the parameters such as `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata` and `spec` can't be defined and wont be passed to K8s.** ==

```Yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod #apiVersion + kind is ritual default, can't write other params without this.
metadata: # Metadata of the pod: name + labels are labels/key-value pairs for IDs, can be used to identify the pod
  name: multicontainer-pod
  labels:
    app: multicontainer-pod
    type: web
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: write-container #as per convenience, name can be anything
      image: alpine:latest #image name
      command: ["/bin/sh"] #assessing the shell of the container to run the following script in the given args section
      args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"] #write command
      volumeMounts: #mounting this Container volume to Pod
        - name: multicontainer-vol #name of the Containervolume = name of the PodVolume emptyDir{}
          mountPath: /var/tmp
    - name: serve-container #ALL AS SAME AS THE ABOVE!
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      volumeMounts:
        - name: multicontainer-vol
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
    - name: multicontainer-vol
      emptyDir: {}
```

```sh
curl <IP>
```
**works the same as we used to see the same in previous shared-volume concept.** Feel free to inspect the same.

```sh
kubectl describe po <podname>
kubectl events po <podname>
```
can check the `cmd`, `arg` and the `mounts` of each of the Container.

This approach is called as `multicontainer-pod`

> 	Here in this image, if i have to perform any actions such as passing cmds, running processes, functions of jobs. it is possible using `command` param under `spec`. 
	
> 	This can be a single or a combo of commands. It is more like **`ENTRYPOINT`** in Dockerfile, if we compare the same with docker. As same, there is an another named **`args`** param which works similar to **`CMD`**.
	
	`command: 
		["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 30; done"]`
	`args: 
		["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]`
	
	**Decoding this param:**  
	**`command`**: helps us access the shell of that image. **/bin/bash**
	**`args`**: runs cmd's inside that image since we accessed the shell. in this, we are looking forward to run a command every ten seconds. to apply that logic,
	**running an infinity while loop running a command with setting up a timer.**
	    **`args`**: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
	1. `"-c", `= indicates that we are passing cmds
	2. `"while true` = "cmd of while loop starting and declare the same where it is true in condition. 
	3. `;`is followed by next steps.
	4. `do date` = do  - passes command that whatever we declare. here we pass date. 
	5. `>> /var/tmp/index.html;`  = passing that to where?, >> - towards a file or dir. 
	6. `sleep 10;` - sleep command helps pause running a command for the time we define. here 10 seconds. every 10secs the command gets executed.
	7. `done"` - closing that loop following by.
	
	Now, lets check the rest.
	```
	kubectl get po -o wide #checking pod status
	curl ip #check output, prints date and time every 10secs
	kubectl describe po podname #shows all the details
	```
	while describing the pod:
	`kubectl describe po podname` shows all the container details. We have spun up two containers, **one generates data** and **one serves it**. 
	- 1 container runs a while loop printing date every ten seconds passes it to the **/var/tmp/index.html** file. whatever that stores in that `index.html` file (which that i sotre it in that volume), gets used on.
	- another 1 container which prints that data to web.
	-> this became possible with the help of `volumeMount` which shares data in between.

>THE MULTI-CONTAINER POD WITH VOLUME SHARING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED.
