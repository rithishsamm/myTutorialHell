14. POD Lifecycle: restart policy
###### Pod Lifecycle Restart Policy - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F9.Pod%20Lifecycle%20Restart%20Policy.docx)

same spec but more about `restart-policy` just like in `docker-compose`.
>THE `pod-restart` policy will be defined on pod level, not on container level.

**On that note of POD Lifecycle: restart policy, the  `restart-policy` of has to be declared under  `spec:` section,** not under but above or below of containers or volumes but not under containers.

**What are all the supported policies that we have?**
1) Never
2) Always - default
3) OnFailure

| Restart Policy                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| --restart=Failure             | Containers gets started by kubelet only if it gets failed with exit code > 0. Only if any failure.

	Note: **We have few things to be consider when we work with `restart-policy`**:
	1) Backoff Delay - restarts containers for every **10s, 20s, 30s..5mins,** if it throws exit code either 0 or 1.  
	2) After restarting under backoff delay, it'll watch the container where the event has occurred for **10mins** whether it fails back or not. after 10mins without any fail, backoff delay gets turned off and backs up to 0 and do the same. 
THIS IS HOW `kubelet` HANDLES THE `restart-policy` FOR OUR CONTAINERS.

> [!NOTE] Note
> 1) Kubelet restarts container with exponential back-off delay of 10s, 20s, 30s
> 2) Kubelet resets the backoff timer for the container, if no problem found for 10mins

for context:
- exit 0 -> exit if the shell prints the date successfully
- exit 1 -> exit if fails
###### Will see how to write/apply one: 
##### `always`:
(if nothing declared, default policy will get applied with is :`always`) here's the manifest of launching a multi-container pod. 

In this multi-container pod, one being a writer saving the data and one serves it the web. since, we haven't applied any `restart-policy` to these. So, **always** as default. 

Will check that, simply apply the same and see,
```yaml
kubectl create -f podManifestFile.yaml
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl describe po <podname>
```
scroll down and you'll find no `restart policy` under that. lol. also in the pod level too. nothing, 

You will find that by printing that `YAML` of the same. fetching pod related information in the yaml format.
```yaml
kubectl get po -o yaml 
kubectl get po podname -o yaml | grep restart
```
in the container section, under the spec of it, will find that. 
	restartPolicy: Always

HENCE PROVED THAT IF NO restart-policy is declared, it goes with the default which is `Always`. 
-> WHAT DOES IT MEAN?  Failure by any means exit by 0, exit 0, whatever 0, it will always restarts the container. 
###### check this by causing a failure to this pod:
to do that, will make a slight change in the `yaml` file
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hexrapp-writer
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10;exit 0; done"]
```
```yaml
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10;exit 1; done"]
```
- exit 0 -> exit if the shell prints the date successfully
- exit 1 -> exit if fails

which prints the date and terminates the container. 
```
NAME                multicontainer-podwithpolicies
READY               2/2
STATUS              Running/NotReady/CrashLoopBackOff
RESTARTS            `n`
AGE                 (38s ago)-93s
IP                  10.244.11.134
NODE                workernode124
NOMINATED NODE      <none> 
READINESS GATES     <none>
```
restartPolicy: Always -
MADE THE POD TO, since the policy is in restart.
=> Running  -> Not Ready -> CrashLoopBackOff. Code exits, fails, runs back and CrashLoop . Backs off. Reruns . 
> **Benefit of restartPolicy: Always. it keeps on try and run even if the container fails to keep stuff running.** even if the `exit code: 0`

If the `exit code:1`? runs and exits again!
```
NAME                multicontainer-podwithpolicies
READY               2/2
STATUS:             ContainerCreating/Running/Error/CrashLoopBackOff
RESTARTS            `n`
AGE                 (38s ago)-93s
IP                  10.244.11.134
NODE                workernode124
NOMINATED NODE      <none> 
READINESS GATES     <none>
```

No matter `0` or `1`, restartPolicy : `Always` does its job. and backs off after multiple tries, eventually.

WITH THIS LOGIC APPLIED, THE CONTAINER MUST RESTART DUE TO IT'S `restart-policy` 
```sh
kubectl create -f podmanifestfile.yaml
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl get po -o wide -w
kubectl describe po <podname> 
```
Throws: running and notReady one on one and can see by describing exit code, restart count and policy  proved!
> => IT JUST KEEPS ON STARTING THE CONTAINER ALWAYS.

##### `on-failure;`
JUST ADDING ONE MORE PARAMETER which is `restart-policy` :

restarts if container on failure by any means. 
kubelet don't bother doing anything as per the policy. since the job gets done once successfully. verify the same by

> [!NOTE] Title
> these `restart-policy` should be declared only under the spec section NOT THE CONTAINERS. Can be declared above or below container section under spec.


```yaml
spec:
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
  containers:
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; exit 0 #&&1; done"]
  ...
```

```
kubectl describe po podname
```
output: 
if exit code `0`:
	  State:               Terminated
      Reason:           Completed
      Exit Code:       0
if exit code `0<`:
	  State:               Terminated
      Reason:           Error
      Exit Code:       1
restarts: OnFailure, ContainerCreating -> Running -> Error -> CrashLoopBackOf -> RestartsAgain.

##### `never;`
JUST MODDING THAT ONE PARAMETER which is `restart-policy` :

> [!NOTE] Title
> these `restart-policy` should be declared only under the spec section NOT THE CONTAINERS. Can be declared above or below container section under spec.
```yaml
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
  ...
```
if exit code `0`:
one of the container will get down and never restarts if anything occurs since we declared restart policy as never. 
2/2 Ready and Running -> *container exits so stops* -> 1/2 NotReady.
if exit code `1`:
2/2 Ready and Running -> *container exits so stops* -> 1/2 Error. 
only error status and nothing else.
