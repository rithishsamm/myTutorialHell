#### 8. POD resource allocation CPU and Memory + Extra parameters
**POD resource allocation CPU and Memory + Extra parameters such as environment variables, resource blocks and more**

previously on pod manifest, we have seen apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, in that containers in name, tag, ports, container volumes
but not seen **PORTS, ENV-VAR, Resource Block + Shared Volumes/Storage.**

NOW, WILL DIG DEEPER INTO MORE PARAMETERS/FACTORS such as
1) allocating resources
 - CPU
 - Memory
 - storage and more
2) Environment variables
3) Resource limiting (for containers inside the POD which doesn't effect the node)
4) Volume mounting in brief
5) Other blocks, such as
- Resource block
- port block

**Volume Block Demystification Overview:**
We have just worked on it bluntly. Will have an insight on how this works.
Thumb rule: Name of the container volumes = Name of the Pod Volume
1) Volume of container's - Container Volume
-- which the name, and the `WORKDIR` path has been defined
2) Volume of Pod's - Shared Pod Volume
**Referring to the diagram:**
Container volume - named here as mounts that the name itself says that.
```
     volumeMounts:
      - name: hexr-vol
        mountPath: /var/wwww/html
```
Volume mount path that which of the directory that you want to expose.
-> Inside the container as we speak the CONTAINER VOLUME, we are performing mounting a `WORKDIR` folder which is exposed that to be mounted with
-> The Shared storage - Pod Volume. Mounted to what volume? 
   ```
volumes: 
    - name: hexr-vol
      emptyDir: {}
```
Volume of Pod's = Shared Storage - Pod Volume.  
>TO MAKE THE CONTAINER WORK WITH THE POD SHARED VOLUME, BOTH OF THE VOLUME NAMES MUST BE IDENTICAL. SAME STRING
> 
**Note: IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE CONTAINER VOLUME ON THE POSHARED VOULME TOO, IT IS MUST THAT *NAME* OF BOTH OF THE VOLUME  SHOULD BE IDENTICAL TO BE MAPPED** 

++

Apart from Containers: the resources and data of a POD such as Network, Volume, Libraries that helps running that container, cri and more -> are administrated by `kubelet`
One more point to be noted that, in the 
POD Volume: emptyDir{} -> means that, wherever the pod gets launched on a particular HOST MACHINE and NODE, All these data must gets stored in some `WORKDIR` . For a Pod running in a node, the data get stored in a location - `kubelet`, the default working directory of a `kubelet` is `/var/lib/kubelet/`. Here all the POD related data gets stored here.  -> which is mapped as `emptyDir{}` here.
**WILL SEE MORE IN BRIEF WHEN WE DO THINGS HANDS-ON**.

BACK TO TOPIC! 
###### APPLYING THE SAME YAML TO UNDERSTAND POD RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN BRIEF.
RECALLING THE PERVIOUS `hexrapp.yaml` or other as per ur convenience - POD MANIFEST TO CONTNUE THE SAME.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hexrapp
  labels: 
    app: hexrapp
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: hexrapp
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      resources:
        limits: 
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        requests:
          cpu: "200m"
          memory: "200Mi"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: hexrapp
          mountPath: /var/www/html #or /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
    - name: hexrapp
      emptyDir: {}
```
WE USED THIS MANIFEST TO LAUNCH A POD with One single container.
*Lets reuse the same and add parameters, sections, blocks, environment variables and resource allocation on top of it* How?
**All these params applied to Container section**
1) **Port block**
```
ports: #optional, proceeds with the default
 - name: hexr-port #naming the port block
   containerPort: 80 #port number specifiacatino
   protocol: TCP #none changes if not declared, goes default
```
2) **Environment Variables:**  
```
env:
  - name: DB_USER #name of the env var
    value: "admin" #value to that var
#creds to login after a successfull container launch, print env
```
3) **Resource Block:** by default, no resource limit has been defined. Dynamic Usage - Amount of CPU and Memory to be utilized **min** or **max** limited to the available resources of the container.  -> (which is taken care of `cgroup` under the hood) 
Why? 
**One set of application must not affect the other set of resources or components due to the over utilization of the container we deployed in the POD. Either both the control plane or compute plane.**


**Guide to `Resource` limit: Two params:**
1) **Limits** 
2) **Requests** 

**limits**: - **maximum that you can use - CPU and Memory** 
#.container should not use more than the given limit **(MAX LIMIT)**
1) cpu: "500m" # core or percent or micron **0.5**/ **50%** # **1**core/**1000m**(icrons)/**100%** util
2) memory: "500Mi" # **Ki** -kb, **Mi**-mb, **Gi**-gb, **Ti**-tb 
**requests**: **minimum limit has to be allowed/allocated for that resource**
#.how much resources to be allocated, in-demand **(MIN LIMIT)** required
1)  cpu: "200m" # core allocated
2) memory: "200Mi"  # memory allocated
```
resources:
  limits: 
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "500Mi"
  requests:
    cpu: "200m"
    memory: "200Mi"
```
4) **volumes:**
> ==**WHATEVER COMMANDS YOU ARE PASSING FROM HERE, DO THEM IN YOUR WORKER NODE. So obvious, that the PODs Components such as containers, network, plugins, volumes and more**. Since all that stuff lies there. ==
> HOST: `emptyDir: {}`<-mounted-> `/var/www/html` - WORKDIR of the container

**volumeMount**: #.from containers-mounting this one to emptyDir{} + whatever data written here will be appear -> also in emptyDir{}
**volumes**: #.volume of Path's container volume gets mounted to emptyDir{} a.k.s Host Volume
```
  containers:
      volumeMounts:
        - name: podapp-vol
          mountPath: /var/www/html 
  volumes:
    - name: podapp-vol
      emptyDir: {} #volume of Path's container volume gets mounted to emptyDir{} a.k.s HostVolume
```
will see more on Volumes to work in brief with storage solutions.

**PASS THE MANIFEST TO SEE THE RESULTS.**
```
kubectl create -f app.yaml
kubectl get po -o wide
curl <podIP>
```
CHECK ALL THE METRICS PASSED,
For monitoring the usage:
```
kubectl top nod
kubectl top pod
```

**TO DO THAT, NEED TO LOG INTO THE CONTAINER. HOW TO LOG INTO THE CONTAINER**
```
kubectl exec -it podname -c <containername(if multiple con inside a pod)> -- bash
```
VOILA! LOGGED IN! -> base machine of nginx -> `debian`  - basic cmds can be ran. + check the specs that are applied in the POD manifest. 

1) **environment variables:**
```
env
printenv
```

 All the ENV VAR can be shown. can find `DB_USER=admin`
2) **resources:**
```
kubectl describe no #prints all the nodes
kubectl describe no <nodenameo>
kubectl describe po -A#prints all the pods 
kubectl describe po <poname>
```
no:
- all the pods and its utilization that are running in that node
- specs of that node
- events and logs of the node
po:
- spec of that po, the containers inside that Pod
- info about the pod
- events and logs of the pod

specifically:  the running / deployed workload's information. such as
- utilization
- limits
- events 
- logs
- specs
- network information
- node/pod/workload information

shows the specs and can verify the resources given there. 
3) **volumes:**
```
kubectl get po <containername> -o wide
sudo ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods
```
the directory says that it is a pod but those are, ALL THE VOLUMES OF EACH OF THE PODS. **BUT, What we have is name, but here everything is in IDs. HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS**? IDs - UID
```
kubectl get po -o yaml
```
all these data came from `etcd` FYI.  Here, will filter out the volume as we need it.
```
kubectl get po -o yaml | grep "uid"
kubectl get podname -o yaml | grep "uid"
```
you get the `uid` of the pod.
```
sudo ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/"uid"
```

THIS IS THE VOLUME MOUNT BETWEEN THE `container` and the `KUBELET`. Inside that `uid`,
```
kubernetes.io-empty-dir
kubernetes.io-projected
```
```
cd kubernetes.io-empty-dir
ls
<volume's-name>
```
>**TLDR**: SINCE BOTH ARE MOUNTED BIDIRECTIONAL, WHATEVER DATA WILL POPS UP ON, BOTH
>- /var/www/html - container
>- /var/lib/kubelet/pods/uid/kubernetes.io-empty-dir/volume-name/ -system

**The Rabbit hole of Volume:**
```
ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/ #volumes of the pod in UID
ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/"uid"/ #components of that po
ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/"uid"/volumes #volumes of po
ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/"uid"/volumes/k8s~empty-dir #volume mount of the container to the pod
ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/"uid"/volumes/k8s~empty-dir/VolName(notTheMount)/ #.here's where all the data will be stored!
```
in abstract:
```
sudo ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/c51418d3-09a8-472b-95d1-1bce87ebe02f/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/podapp-vol/
```
#.here's where all the data will be stored! whichever gets generated in that Container. stored here in this POD volume too with the help of Volume mounting.

Here, we mostly see the folder is totally empty because, 
the directory `/var/www/html` is an empty dir. and we have no data there! 
also you can have `/usr/share/nginx/html` which is nginx's default dir. to see some content.
``` 
containers:
      volumeMounts:
        - name: hexrapp #name of the mount
          mountPath: /var/www/html 
#or /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
    - name: hexrapp #name of the volume
      emptyDir: {}
```
Will fix this!

What will do is, will delete the pod for now and rewrite to make the proper mount to happen since there is the default working directory is a mismatch.

Will mount the same with `/usr/share/nginx/html`

**So, Make the changes as you want in that POD Manifest File.** by replacing volumes of the container as:
```
containers:
      volumeMounts:
        - name: hexrapp #name of the mount
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
    - name: hexrapp #name of the volume
      emptyDir: {}
```
To apply the changes, You can simply go do `kubectl delete po podname`. But,
>Note: Instead of deleting a POD. You can also replace it. So, simply replace by passing 
```
kubectl replace --force -f pathofthe/pod.yaml
```
again surf the volume and go do the same.
```
kubectl get po -o yaml | grep "uid"
kubectl get podname -o yaml | grep "uid"
ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/"uid"/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/podapp-vol/
```
might wonder that both of these are same. But the thing is, It is empty on the POD too. Still the same but the default directory is the step we have gone through. What is means?

What happens in the background is. since the default directory is empty itself!, you cant `curl` nothing. try `curl` the IP.
```
kubectl get po -o wide
curl IP
```
Prints `403 Forbidden`. It supposed to print `Welcome to nginx` right?

To make that happen, simply create the same. for the volume mount to get successful.
```
touch index.html
nano index.html
```
```
<h1>Welcome to K8s PodApp Pod's Container's Nginx's Volume from EmptyDir{}</h1>
#or anything else
```
```
curl IP
```
 **Working! :). Means whatever that we have loaded here in terms of data we stored here `emptyDir{}`**, **WILL BE SPAWNED IN THE CONTAINER TOO - `/usr/shared/nginx/html`!**
 
WILL SEE MORE ON THIS IN PRACTICE. **More about Shared Volume.** here we have seen with only one container. Will see that in brief in detail doing the same with **Multiple containers**.
