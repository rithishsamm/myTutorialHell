12. POD initContainers Introduction
###### Pod initContainers - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F8.Pod%20initContainers.docx)

So far, we have seen DEPLOYING THE APPLICATION USING POD by defining the specs in the `container` section. 

Will be seeing much more sections for best practices for deploying PRODUCTION GRADE INFRA.


There are few types of containers that do exist in this K8s Environment. Will see all these definition, purpose and benefits, , such as:
- **init Containers**
- **Sidecar Containers**
- **Ephemeral Containers**
initContainer - Initializing containers before anything.

We saw how to deploy apps using **pod** and exposing the same in and out of the K8s Cluster by defining all that in a container section on the PODs Manifest YAML file.

Now, will see another section inside that POD - **`initContainer`** Pod.
###### initContainer Pod:
- **initContainer** will run/create before **app container** defined under containers section.
> **Traditional Containers:** To create a POD: Pod manifest -> we write apiVersion and Kind ->  specs -> and under that, will define all the containers. 
> 
> **initContainers**: If we create the POD with InitContainer, as same as above-> apiV, kind, spec and container -> ++an extra param name`initContainer` :
> Doing this creating a POD,  ==**the initContainer will be created first**==, after that the rest of them gets spinned up. 
> 
> **==initContainer==** = initializing containers.
> **THE FIRST CONTAINERS TO GET CREATED WHEN WE LAUNCH A POD.**

- `initContainers` will not be in running state. it will be shown as ==completed state== 
>and gets terminated showing exit code as 0.
>
Once, the task of launching the InitContainers, it will run towards completion. **`initContainers`** always run to completion.
>
Each **`initContainer`** must complete successfully before the next one starts whenever you launch a pod with **`initContainers`** written in it.

- It works similar to regular actual containers, but each `initContainer` must complete successfully before next one starts
>but all of each `initContainer` must be completed launching successfully one by one before next regular container gets starts. One at a time one by one completely. 
>
>-e.g.: In a pod manifest writing a multi-container pod configuration, you declare one initContainer and one regular container with all the same specs defined. `initContainer` will get created first one by one in order as per convenience, after that the rest will be done.

- if `initContainer` fails, kubelet restarts `initContainer` s until it is succeeds (unless if `restartPolicy` is not set to `Never`)
> if `initContainer` fails, **kubelet** will keep on restarts the `initContainer` until it gets succeeded unless if there any `restartPolicy` **= never** applied to it.

- `initContainers` do not support **`probes`** and **`lifecycle`**.
> All the PARAMETERS of specs and stuff in the container section  which can be applied to regular containers, can be applied to `initContainers` too. except **probes** and **lifecycle**. 

###### initContainers Use cases: 
**how this is beneficial to us?**
1) To do some initial setup before actual application comes up.
>to get deployed. 
>e.g.: launching an `nginx` application. before that `nginx` comes up, i'd like to make changes or modify some parameter in the kernel or to the system and such. 
>SUCH ACTION CAN BE APPLIED in the **`initContainers`** since these things will get launched first, does its job(like a prerequisites before launching the same).  or can be disposed to. 

2) To run some code/script as part of initialization before the app gets created.
>to run scripts, code and processes as a part or before the initialization of the actual application get created or deployed. things which are operational intensive and not has to be a part of a regular application deployment can be declared here in `initContainers` as a separate process or as a job. makes it up and ready to go.   

3) to do kernel changes or application specific 
>plus, kernel changes for app specific use cases. uses cases such as running distroless containers and such. 

4) `initContainer`s can be ran n number of times. No strings attached, no restrictions just like regular containers. 

NOT MUCH OF DEAL! 
JUST A SINGLE PARAMETER GETS CHANGED FOR THE SAME.
###### How to write one? 
**NO ROCKET SCIENCE!** **JUST SIMPLE PARAMETERS GETS CHANGED FOR THE SAME!** to create these `initContainers`. Will see that in practice. 

Will get this by referring the diagram and understand how this `initContainer` works inside a POD in detail.

initContainer POD (Demo)

![[Pasted image 20240911181845.png]]

Here, we are trying to create a Pod. which has its own IP that communicates to your application where the frontier container is `nginx` here who serves content by acting as a server listening port 80. this how the communication happens. 

==ACCESSING THE APPLICATION WILL BE DONE BY THE USERS via **`PodIP/hostPort:PortNumber`**==. SAME STUFF AS BEFORE as we launched these `multicontainer-pod`.

Here, we have an another container. WHY IS THIS HERE AND WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF IT. 
`initContainer` = onetime, disposable container defined to run one job or program to run the same.

**Use case**: 
1) as same as the multi-container pod architecture.
2) for the `initContainer`, the job that it has to perform is:
- pull an `index.html` from GITHUB
- and store it into `/var/tmp`
- since, `/var/tmp` is mounted to POD's emptyDir{} Shared Volume, `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/'podUID'/volumes/kubernetes:emptyDir/`
- once, the `initContainer` serves it purpose by completing the relevant task, gets disposed for once and goes into **Completed** state.  
- it spawns to same to `serve-container` too, 
- lying in the `/usr/share/nginx/html`
- which will be in running status, has its data and it keep serving to the web. 

	It has to contact my github, pull essential files and has to be stored in **/var/tmp** directory inside the container. 
	WHICH IS MOUNTED TO THE **SHARED VOLUME** by default and it will be existed here too in the mounted directory which is
**/var/lib/kubelet/pods/'podUID'/volumes/kubernetes:emptyDir/**. 
	Once the process/job of pulling and storing the same gets completed, the **`initContainer`**'s status will be shown as and goes into completed state and gets terminated showing exit code as 0. IT IS A ONE TIME PROCESS AND AFTER IT GET COMPLETED, WE COULD ACCESS THE SAME.
	
**where the `nginx`container will be shown as Running state in status since it is an application container.**

	Since the shared volume has the data which has been spawned by the `initContainer` which be seen in the `nginx` container's `WORKDIR` which is **/usr/share/nginx/html** too. which end up delivering the same content on the server too.
###### writing the same in a .yaml file. all the same but xtra parameters for initContainers:
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: init-container-pod
  labels:
    app: init-container-pod
    image: nginx
    type: web
    object: initContainer
spec:
#container-section
  containers:
  - name: web-container
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent #always, IfNotPresent, Never
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      name: http
      protocol: TCP
      hostPort: 8091
      hostIP: 192.168.0.222
    volumeMounts:
    - name: init-container-volume
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
#initContainer-section
#these containers will run first during pod initialization and will be stopped after pod creation
  initContainers:
  - name: init-container
    image: alpine
    command:
    - wget
    - -O
    - /var/tmp/index.html
    - https://github.com/sudheerduba/initContainer_demo/blob/main/index.html?raw=true #copy paste url + add ?raw=true to get raw content
    volumeMounts:
    - name: init-container-volume
      mountPath: /var/tmp
#where these containers secton has been written under spec section
#volumemount-section
  volumes:
  - name: init-container-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```
> - Will passing this pod manifest, `initcontainers` will get launched and gets into **completed** stage and done. 
> - After this one gets completed successfully, the rest of the containers will get launched and will be in **running** state.

**Here, will specifically focus on `initContainer`** 
```yaml
  initContainers:
  - name: init-container
    image: alpine
    command:
    - wget
    - -O
    - /var/tmp/index.html
    - https://github.com/sudheerduba/initContainer_demo/blob/main/index.html?raw=true #copy paste url + add ?raw=true to get raw content
    volumeMounts:
    - name: init-container-volume
      mountPath: /var/tmp
```
