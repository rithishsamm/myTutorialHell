###### Â Integrating VS code with K8s Cluster - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F2.Integrating%20VS%20code%20with%20K8s%20Cluster.pdf)
SETUP:
1) 2 VMs,
- One Control Plane - 2vCPU, 2GB Ram, 12GB Storage
- One worker Node - same
2) Visual Studio Code
3) Install Remote-SSH Extension
**Objective**: WANT TO WRITE KUBERNETES YAML FILES FROM HERE FOR ALL THE ESSENTIAL SETUP ON THESE VIRTUAL MACHINES.

Taking VM in remote and making YAML Manifests instead of inside the machine since it is only CLI. So, Write in local , Execute in remote

Visual Studio Code -> SSH Icon -> Open SSH Configuration File -> open terminal and land in `c:\users\username\.ssh\` 
```
ssh-keygen.exe
<enter>empty
y
<enter>empty - no passphrase
```
Key got generated. Copy public key fingerprint to that machine. 
```
ssh-copy-key username@ip
```
> DOING **PASSWORD-LESS KEY-BASED AUTH** instead of **PASSWORD BASED AUTH**

SSH -> Connect to Host -> add hosts `username@ip` -> add config -> Connect back to host. Voila!

**SMOOTH AS BUTTER!**
