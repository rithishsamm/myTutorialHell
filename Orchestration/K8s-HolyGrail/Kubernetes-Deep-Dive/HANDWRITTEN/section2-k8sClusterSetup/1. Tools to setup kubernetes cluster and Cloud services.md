Cluster setup - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2Fofficial%2FMaster%20Docker%20and%20Kubernetes%2Fsection2%2FTools%20to%20setup%20kubernetes%20cluster%20and%20cloud%20service)
#### Kubernetes Setup Tools and Services

need to know what are all the tools and services to setup Kubernetes on both on-premise and on the cloud.
### **on-prem:**
###### 1) Kubeadm 
 is a tool which is used for a secure production grade-level deployment. 
if you want to create a Kubernetes cluster on-premise on production level, Kubeadm is the g-to solution.

According to Redhat, `Kubeadm` provides knowledge of the life-cycle management of Kubernetes clusters, including self-hosted layouts, dynamic discovery services, etc. Had it belonged to the new [operators world](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-a-kubernetes-operator?intcmp=701f20000012ngPAAQ), it may have been named a "Kubernetes cluster operator."

If to practice Kubernetes, setting up a kubernetes cluster where it is a single node, multi-node or HA Setup. Kubeadm will work just fine! 
> Moreover, all the Kubernetes certifications like  CKA, CKS, CKAD, They will be deploying kubernetes on **Kubeadm**. Applies to the examination as well.

Reason why? the series of course covering the same in order to setup K8s setup for single node,, multi-node and HA Setup. 
***
###### 2) minikube
for single node (one compute plane + one worker node). Practicing K8s here deploying and setting up the same in the local system and deploy applications, minikube would be a wise solution. easy to manage.
> having some in-built addons enable and disable on fly in ease just using commands making API calls.

According to docs,
minikube quickly sets up a local Kubernetes cluster on macOS, Linux, and Windows. We proudly focus on helping application developers and new Kubernetes users.
Highlights
- Supports the latest Kubernetes release (+6 previous minor versions)
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Deploy as a VM, a container, or on bare-metal
- Multiple container runtimes (CRI-O, containerd, docker)
- Direct API endpoint for blazing fast [image load and build](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/)
- Advanced features such as [LoadBalancer](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/#loadbalancer-access), filesystem mounts, FeatureGates, and [network policy](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/network_policy/)
- [Addons](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/deploying/#addons) for easily installed Kubernetes applications
- Supports common [CI environments](https://github.com/minikube-ci/examples)
***
###### 3) kubespray
if kubespray, i can deploy this particular Kubernetes Cluster on-premise and on cloud as well. AWS, Azure, GCP whatever. Can spin up kubernetes cluster over there by using kubespray. On-premise data center too. No problem. Works just fine.

According to its docs, with the help of various automation tools. Kubespray is a combination of Kubernetes and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/?intcmp=701f20000012ngPAAQ). That means we can install Kubernetes using Ansible. We can also deploy clusters using `kubespray` on cloud compute services like EC2 (AWS). 

- Can be deployed on **[AWS](https://kubespray.io/#/docs/cloud_providers/aws), GCE, [Azure](https://kubespray.io/#/docs/cloud_providers/azure), [OpenStack](https://kubespray.io/#/docs/cloud_providers/openstack), [vSphere](https://kubespray.io/#/docs/cloud_providers/vsphere), [Equinix Metal](https://kubespray.io/#/docs/cloud_providers/equinix-metal) (bare metal), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (Experimental), or BareMetal**
- **Highly available** cluster
- **Composable** (Choice of the network plugin for instance)
- Supports most popular **Linux distributions**
- **Continuous integration tests**
- Kubespray provides deployment flexibility. It allows you to deploy a cluster quickly and customize all aspects of the implementation.
- Kubespray strikes a balance between flexibility and ease of use.
- You only need to run one Ansible playbook and your cluster ready to serve.
> a moderate k8s setup tool. does generic configuration management tasks from the "OS operators" Ansible world, with some initial K8s clustering (with networking plugins included) and control plane bootstrapping. consume life-cycle management domain knowledge and offload generic OS configuration tasks from it.
> 
>  nothing but generic but kubeadm providing certs and secure setup in ease.

***
###### 4) KOPS - Kubernetes Operations
kOPS by RedHat inc. Kubernetes Operations. `kubectl` for clusters. 

According to docs, `kops` will not only help you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly available, Kubernetes cluster, but it will also provision the necessary cloud infrastructure. [AWS](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/aws/) (Amazon Web Services) and [GCE](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/gce/) (Google Cloud Platform) are currently officially supported, with [DigitalOcean](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/digitalocean/), [Hetzner](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/hetzner/) and [OpenStack](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/openstack/) in beta support, and [Azure](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/azure/) in alpha.

**Features**
- Automates the provisioning of Highly Available Kubernetes clusters
- Built on a state-sync model for **dry-runs** and automatic **idempotency**
- Ability to generate [Terraform](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/terraform/)
- Supports **zero-config** managed kubernetes [add-ons](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/addons/)
- Command line [autocompletion](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/cli/kops_completion/)
- YAML Manifest Based API [Configuration](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/manifests_and_customizing_via_api/)
- [Templating](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/operations/cluster_template/) and dry-run modes for creating Manifests
- Choose from most popular CNI [Networking](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/networking/) providers out-of-the-box
- Multi-architecture ready with ARM64 support
- Capability to add containers, as hooks, and files to nodes via a [cluster manifest](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/cluster_spec/)

> But to break, despite all the gimmicks, kOPS are very much friendly with Cloud. Especially AWS and GCP. Yet to support on other cloud platforms too.

###### Kind - Kubernetes in the Docker
a simple tool. low level tool which help you setup the same single node single cluster as containers. Instead of VM or BareMetal, Things work on a Docker Container. means, the control plane and Worker node = will be as a Container. Inside, we will be running al of our PODS. -

According to docs, [kind](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”.  
kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.
kind consists of:
- Go [packages](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/tree/main/pkg) implementing [cluster creation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/tree/main/pkg/cluster), [image build](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/tree/main/pkg/build), etc.
- A command line interface ([`kind`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/tree/main/main.go)) built on these packages.
- Docker [image(s)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/tree/main/images) written to run systemd, Kubernetes, etc.
- [`kubetest`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/kubetest) integration also built on these packages (WIP)
kind bootstraps each “node” with [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm/). For more details see [the design documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/design/initial).
**NOTE**: kind is still a work in progress, see the [1.0 roadmap](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/1.0-roadmap).
