### PROMPT :
I couldn't able to see swap on my ubuntu vm running on vbox.  Even after passing swap on. This is what i get in /etc/fstab

admin123@cp123 :~$ sudo cat /etc/fstab 
[sudo] password for admin 123: 
```
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# Device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# That works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab (5).
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>

```

No swap here. 

Im trying run it as a k 8 s node but even after swapoff -a, the kubeapi server fails to run. How do i get to see swap so that i can disable it and bootstrap my node to run the same..

### ANSWER:

You're encountering this issue because **there is no swap configured** on your Ubuntu VM ‚Äî not even a swap partition or swap file ‚Äî which is why:

- `swapoff -a` does nothing (or succeeds silently),
- `/etc/fstab` has no swap entry,
- And tools like `free -h`, `swapon --show`, or `cat /proc/swaps` show **no swap**.

However, **Kubernetes requires that swap be disabled**, and if it's not explicitly disabled (even if not currently active), `kubelet` will **fail to start** with an error like:

```
system verification failed: [unsupported feature: Swap]
```

Even if swap isn't active, **kubelet does not allow swap to be enabled at all**, even if off. So you need to make sure:
1. No swap is present or active.
2. Swap is disabled at boot.
3. Kubelet is told to tolerate no swap (if you really want to bypass ‚Äî **not recommended**).

Let‚Äôs walk through how to **detect, optionally add, and properly disable swap** so that Kubernetes can run.

---

### üîç Step 1: Confirm There Is No Swap

Run these commands:

```bash
sudo swapon --show
free -h
cat /proc/swaps
```

If all are empty or show 0, then **swap is not active and not configured** ‚Äî which is good, but we must ensure it's **permanently disabled**.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Make Sure Swap Is Disabled Permanently

Even if there‚Äôs no swap now, if the system *could* use swap in the future (e.g., via a config file), kubelet will complain.

#### Option A: Disable swap entirely (recommended)

Run:

```bash
# Turn off any existing swap (harmless if none)
sudo swapoff -a

# Comment or remove any swap line in /etc/fstab
sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab
```

> This command comments out any line containing the word `swap` in `/etc/fstab`.

Verify:

```bash
cat /etc/fstab
```

You should see no active `swap` entries.

Also disable swap from being mounted at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.mount  # optional, sometimes mounts swap
```

But most importantly, **prevent systemd from auto-enabling swap**.

---

### üß© Step 3: Ensure Kubelet Doesn't Complain About Swap

Even if swap is off, **kubelet checks for swap and fails if it finds any trace**.

You have two options:

---

#### ‚úÖ Option 1: Proper Way ‚Äî Run Kubernetes Without Swap (Recommended)

Ensure `swapoff -a` is persistent across reboots.

Add to `/etc/rc.local` or create a systemd drop-in.

But simpler: just **make sure no swap exists**, and **pass the right flag to kubelet** via kubeadm.

When initializing your node, tell `kubeadm` to ignore swap prerequisites:

> ‚ùå Don‚Äôt do this unless you know what you‚Äôre doing ‚Äî but for dev/test VMs, it's common.

```bash
sudo kubeadm init --node-name cp123 --ignore-preflight-errors=Swap
```

Or when joining:

```bash
sudo kubeadm join ... --ignore-preflight-errors=Swap
```

Alternatively, configure kubelet to allow no swap via systemd.

Edit the kubelet config:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/default
echo "KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=--fail-swap-on=false" | sudo tee /etc/default/kubelet
```

Then restart kubelet:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: `--fail-swap-on=false` is deprecated in newer versions, but still works in 1.28‚Äì1.29. In v 1.30+, swap is strictly disallowed.

---

#### üõë Option 2: Add Swap and Then Disable It (Not Needed Here)

You said you want to "see" swap ‚Äî maybe you think one should exist?

But adding swap just to disable it is unnecessary.

However, if you ever want to **add a swap file** (for general Linux knowledge):

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

# Make permanent
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

Then disable it:

```bash
sudo swapoff -a
sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab
```

But again: **you don‚Äôt need swap for Kubernetes** ‚Äî better to have none.

---

### üß™ Step 4: Verify System Is Ready for Kubernetes

```bash
free -h            # Should show 0B swap
swapon --show      # Should output nothing
cat /proc/swaps    # Should be empty
cat /etc/fstab     # No active swap lines
```

Then check kubelet:

```bash
sudo systemctl status kubelet
journalctl -u kubelet -n --since "5 minutes ago"
```

Look for errors like `swap is not supported`.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Checklist for Kubernetes Node

| Task | Done? |
|------|-------|
| Swap is off (`swapoff -a`) | ‚úÖ |
| Swap not in `/etc/fstab` | ‚úÖ |
| Kubelet started with `--fail-swap-on=false` or via `--ignore-preflight-errors=Swap` | ‚úÖ |
| `kubelet` service restarted after config change | ‚úÖ |

---

### üí° Summary

You **don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúsee‚Äù swap**. In fact, it's better if it's completely absent.

Your problem isn‚Äôt that swap isn‚Äôt showing ‚Äî it‚Äôs that **kubelet refuses to start unless swap is disabled**, and sometimes even checks for its *potential existence*.

So do this:

```bash
# Ensure swap is off
sudo swapoff -a

# Comment out swap in fstab
sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab

# Tell kubelet to allow no swap
echo "KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=--fail-swap-on=false" | sudo tee /etc/default/kubelet

# Restart kubelet
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Sudo systemctl restart kubelet
```

Then proceed with `kubeadm join` or `kubeadm init` (with `--ignore-preflight-errors=Swap` if needed).

Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

```
  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

```
  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run 
```
"kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml"
```
 with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

```
  kubeadm join 192.168.0.111:6443 --token 7dcid2.fn9ey3dvcyo2fb59 \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:747760edf15e6ea56c7dd6590a9f8d8245b2810eadf7f9f6bce879c7de6648c2 \
        --control-plane --certificate-key 45bc8840b9ffe8d583c84b55d8ca86b7a3a9ad5701dffc4a393895d32551d3be
```
Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
```
kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs
``` 
to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

```
kubeadm join 192.168.0.111:6443 --token 7dcid2.fn9ey3dvcyo2fb59 \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:747760edf15e6ea56c7dd6590a9f8d8245b2810eadf7f9f6bce879c7de6648c2 
```
