Overview on Kubernetes Volumes - [Doc]

**Volumes -**
- Purpose of volumes,
- Why volumes for the workload resources
- When to use
- Where to use
- Limitations of volumes 
- Pros and cons of volumes
- Volumes for both Pods and also the Containers

==**Volumes for Pods are persistent . 
Volumes for containers are ephemeral.**==
Will dig in deep about storage and volumes in brief. 
- In general, containers are **ephemeral** which files will be lost once a containers crashes.
-  Since kubelet restarts containers which comes with clean state data will be lost. 
- When we want to **share data** across container inside the POD, we can use volumes.
- When containers restarts with clean state, POD volume will help to persist the data. Since POD uses volumes as persistent storage solution for containers. 
- Container mounts directory under `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts` to volumes under `.spec.volumes` with common name.
- K 8 s supports two types of volumes,
	- Ephemeral volumes (emptyDir,  configMap, secret, downwardAPI, CSI ephemeral volumes. Etc.,)
	- Persistent volumes (PV -> Static and dynamic with StorageClass)
- Volume types supported by K 8 s,
	- AWS EBS CSI
	- AzureDisk CSI, [[azure_disk]]
	- GCE CSI
	- VSphere CSI
	- CephFS, rbd
	- ConfigMap, secret, downwardAPI, hostPath
	- iSCSI, local, NFS [[nfs-server-setup]]
	- PVC
	- Projected

###### In general, containers are ephemeral which files will be lost once a containers crashes.
Eg: 
- Take a POD.
- No matter if it is a standalone or workload resource based POD.
- And that POD contains containers. 
- Container 1, Container 2
- Until a container gets recreated, the data will be on that container. 
- If a container crashes, data crashes and lost. Where `kubelet` tries to recreate the POD and along with containers. From scratch (like creating a new VM, so the configurations, data's and volumes)
That way containers - ephemeral volumes. Till a container is alive, the data will be alive.  

Once a container goes down, `kubelet` will recreate a new container which results in losing data. 

######  Since kubelet restarts containers which comes with clean state data will be lost. 
Since kubelet restarts containers which comes with clean state data will be lost. -> `kubelet` doesn't restarts the container. It recreates. 

Like in docker, docker container stop -> rm -> run. Not docker restart.  Only recreation, no restarts. Again, which results in losing data creating a new container. 
>  cannot use as persistent volumes, cannot store the data persistently. Cannot modify the configs or the containers itself when the storage is ephemeral.   

###### When we want to share data across  container inside the POD, we can use volumes.
To **share data** across container inside the POD, -> use ==volumes==. 

If we recall the definition of PODs. [[00. section3-full-k8sPods]]] 

> [!NOTE] **What is a POD**
> - ==Pod **creates a logical layer**  
>     to group 1 or more containers = to have **common network** + **shared storage.**==
> - Pod has a unique IP address assigned from `--pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16`
> - Containers inside those POD talks to each other on `localhost` domain or `127.0.0.1`, since container share the same network stack.
> - Containers share data inside POD.
> - In general, we need to create containers inside POD  
>     which are dependent, not different application.

> Point to recall - Pod **creates a logical layer**  
    To group 1 or more containers = to have **common network** + **shared storage.**

The term **shared storage** means here is that -> We can share the data
- **across containers** ->  **inside the PODs.** 
Eg: like what we have done with the **nginx-multicontainer** - `deploy.yaml`

Where we saw two container's working directory, sharing same volumes out of PODs `EmptyDir()` volume.  
![[PodvsContainerStorage]]
**Purpose/Objective:** Volumes used inside the Pod to share the data across the containers. 
**Benefit:** 
- Shared volume across containers inside a POD (using `EmptyDir()`). 
- If a container gets crashed and gets recreated freshly from scratch inside the POD, the data will be persistent not get washed.  (*Data will not be lost which that came out of that dead container, where the volume didn't get deleted.*)
- Where the volume will be deleted if the POD gets deleted, not the container.
> Volumes - a shared storage volume solution to work with the data of the containers inside the POD. 

###### When containers restarts with `clean state`, POD volume will help to persist the data. Since POD uses volumes as persistent storage solution for containers. 
When containers restarts with **clean state**, *POD volume will help to persist the data.*

Since POD uses volumes as persistent storage solution for containers which we just discussed in the above point.  

The core part of the volume is that to share the volume, to provision a persistent storage. Even if it gets crashed and recreated, the volume will not be lost. 

**==For container -  it is a persistent storage, 
For POD - its ephemeral 
Where if the POD gets f'ed up and so the volumes too.==**  


###### Container mounts directory under `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts` to volumes under `.spec.volumes` with common name.

Volume mounting - Container mounts directory under 
> -  `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts` - **Containers**
> - to volumes under `.spec.volumes` with common name.


###### K 8 s supports two types of volumes,
 - **Ephemeral/Temp volumes (emptyDir,  configMap, secret, downwardAPI, CSI ephemeral volumes. Etc.,)**
As we all know, once f'ed, it's f'ed. 
Processes like for eg: RAM's memory, CPU's processes and such.  - which couldn't be persistent where everything gets washed once it gets restarted. 

- **Persistent volumes (PV -> Static and dynamic with StorageClass)**
Persistent is persistent. Like EG: Hard disks, SSD, NAS , Memory card, Pen drive and such.
Persistent - Exists even if there is a restart. 

>  These are the two types of Volumes in K 8 s. 

In these two types of volumes, there are sub types/ format to volumes, and here there are certain volumes types supported in K 8 s,
###### Volume types supported by K 8 s, 
> Note: **CSI, Container Storage Interface** - plugins
- AWS EBS CSI (AWS Elastic Block Storage )
- AzureDisk CSI, [[azure_disk]]
- GCE CSI
- VSphere CSI
- Openstack CSI
- CephFS, rbd
- ConfigMap, secret, downwardAPI, hostPath
- iSCSI, local, NFS [[nfs-server-setup]]
- PVC
- Projected

Varies based on different environments. Takes these plugins, volume types in order to store the data. 

Will dig deep into all the volumes types and see which applies where. 

Since we could not be able to store things with what we are doing, will see ,
- How to work with this 
- How to share data between workloads
- How to persist the data and such.
