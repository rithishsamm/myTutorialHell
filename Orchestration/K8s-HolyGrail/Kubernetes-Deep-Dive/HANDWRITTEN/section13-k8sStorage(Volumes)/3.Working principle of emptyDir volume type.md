Overview on Kubernetes Volumes - [Doc]
```
VolumeType: 
- EmptyDir
```

###### Let see about one of the volume type - **`EmptyDir()`**
And the working principle of `emptyDir` volume type.

Critical points and 
**Working Principles of `EmptyDir()`:**
![[emptyDir()]]

> Nothing different. Exactly same as what we were doing to the `nginx-multicontainer` workload using `emptyDir()` VolumeType for volume which is an **Ephemeral VolumeType**

- We got an application running on a K 8 s Cluster having one **controlplane** and two **workernodes**
- Application deployed using Deployment workload resource object. 
- Deployment, `replica=3`, 2 Pods (Pod 1, Pod 3) on workernode 1, one (Pod 2) on workernode 2. (which gets appropriately distributed based on multiple metrics)
-  here, whenever the Pod uses `EmptyDir()`, which creates a volume directory under `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/Pod'sUID/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/volume_name/data`
- Creates `emptyDir()` under this directory path. 
- Exists until the POD is available. 
- Applies to all the Pods exists here. 
- Here, the context is the The WORKDIR of the container -> mounted -> to `emptyDir()` of the POD.
>  - so For the container, it is persistent
>  - for the PODs, its ephemeral. 

**This is not a wise choice if you want the data to be persistent (good for batch, not recommended for Production purpose) since the `emptyDir()` is totally ephemeral.** 

If we happened to migrate these workloads from one node to to other node, its a brand new directory gets created from scratch which couldn't be reutilized.

Not a viable storage solution for deploying mission critical applications on PODs. 

Will dig deep about this and see why this does and doesn't work in **Practice: `EmptyDir()`**
