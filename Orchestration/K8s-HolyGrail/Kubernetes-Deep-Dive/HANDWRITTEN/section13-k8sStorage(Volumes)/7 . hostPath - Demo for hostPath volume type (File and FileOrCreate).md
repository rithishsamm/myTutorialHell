`HostPath` Demo for `hostPath` volume type (File and `FileOrCreate`)


Next one of `hostpath` - **`FileOrCreate`**. Here on contrast to **`DirectoryOrCreate`** where it mounts directory or create one and gets mounted, here it is point to an entry-point file instead of a directory.

**NOTE: Can use multiple types of Volume Types to one single resource as we can see here.**

Here with this one, applying this manifest out of our template for our example,
```yaml
apiVersion: v1 #apiVersion of the Pod
kind: Pod #Kind of the Object
metadata: #Metadata of the Pod (name, labels as key-value pairs)
name: pod-hostpathfileorcreate
labels:
app: nginx
env: dev
release: v1.0
  
spec: #Spec of the Pod
containers: #Containers under the Pod
- name: write-app
image: alpine:latest
command: ["/bin/sh"]
args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 10; done"] #Command that writes the data to the hostpath PodVolume
volumeMounts: #VolumeMounts of the Container to the hostpath PodVolume.
- name: shareddata-hostpathfileorcreate #Name of the hostpath PodVolume
mountPath: /var/log #hostpath -> PodVolumeType
- name: infodata-hostpathfileorcreate #Name of the hostpath PodVolume:
mountPath: /var/tmp/info.php #hostpath -> PodVolumeType

- name: serve-app
image: nginx:latest
ports:
- containerPort: 80 #Port of the Container
volumeMounts:
- name: shareddata-hostpathfileorcreate
mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
#workDir of the Container mounted to the hostpath PodVolume, serving the data from the hostpath PodVolume

volumes:
- name: infodata-hostpathfileorcreate #Name of the hostpath PodVolume
hostPath:
path: /var/tmp/info.php #hostpath -> PodVolumeType
type: FileOrCreate #here for the FileOrCreate PodVolumeType, we are using it on only the write-app Container along with shared data volumetype

- name: shareddata-hostpathfileorcreate #Name of the emptyDir() PodVolume
hostPath:
path: /var/tmp/nginx-data #hostpath -> PodVolumeType
type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

Apply and verify
```
kubectl create -f /path/to/hostpathfileorcreate.yaml
kubectl get po -o wide
```

Check the mount,
```sh
kubectl exec it PodName -c ContainerName -- sh
ls -l /var/tmp/ #shows the file
```
With the permission of `644`. 

Verify the same in the node too,
```
ssh username@NodeVMIp
ls -l /var/tmp/
```

There you go!

As you can see, if create the file since it didn't exists, or if did gets mounted both on Node and in the container too. 

Perform cleanup,
```
kubectl delete po PodName
```

This works if you declare value as just `File` in VolumeType. 
Since we deleted that file, it exists, and gets mounted, if not, will throw error going (**FailedMount**).

The mount happens once it gets successfull then it performs the rest by pulling the image and executes the rest and spins up the container. 

That is pretty much it for **`FileOrCreate` `hostpath` VolumeType**
