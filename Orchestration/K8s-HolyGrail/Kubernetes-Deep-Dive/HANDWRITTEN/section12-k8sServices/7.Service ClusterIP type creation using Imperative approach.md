# 7. `ClusterIP svc` type creation using Imperative approach
Service ClusterIP type creation using Imperative approach - [Doc]

CREATING THIS `ClusterIP` **svc** USING IMPERATIVE APPROACH:

so far, we have been covering all these by using declarative approach writing manifest for everything and working on the same.

Will see how to work with all these on just from the command line *creating a **ClusterIP`svc`** type of service* (imperatively). NOT JUST `svc` BUT ANY WORKLOAD RESOURCES ALL MATTERS
```
 Possible resources include (case insensitive):

 pod (po), service (svc), replicationcontroller (rc), deployment (deploy), replicaset (rs)
```

For all the imperative practices,
```sh
kubectl expose --help
```
and here you have all the possible ways to do things imperatively.
all the parameters, args, examples and options. 


**Examples:**
```sh
  # Create a service for a replicated nginx, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose rc nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

  # Create a service for a replication controller identified by type and name specified in "nginx-controller.yaml", which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose -f nginx-controller.yaml --port=80 --target-port=8000

  # Create a service for a pod valid-pod, which serves on port 444 with the name "frontend"
  kubectl expose pod valid-pod --port=444 --name=frontend

  # Create a second service based on the above service, exposing the container port 8443 as port 443 with the name "nginx-https"
  kubectl expose service nginx --port=443 --target-port=8443 --name=nginx-https

  # Create a service for a replicated streaming application on port 4100 balancing UDP traffic and named 'video-stream'.
  kubectl expose rc streamer --port=4100 --protocol=UDP --name=video-stream

  # Create a service for a replicated nginx using replica set, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose rs nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

  # Create a service for an nginx deployment, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000
```

**Options:**
```sh
    --allow-missing-template-keys=true:
        If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.

    --cluster-ip='':
        ClusterIP to be assigned to the service. Leave empty to auto-allocate, or set to 'None' to create a headless service.

    --dry-run='none':
        Must be "none", "server", or "clientPOD". If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.

    --external-ip='':
        Additional external IP address (not managed by Kubernetes) to accept for the service. If this IP is routed to a node, the service can be accessed by this IP in addition to its generated service IP.

    --field-manager='kubectl-expose':
        Name of the manager used to track field ownership.

    -f, --filename=[]:
        Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to expose a service

    -k, --kustomize='':
        Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.

    -l, --labels='':
        Labels to apply to the service created by this call.

    --load-balancer-ip='':
        IP to assign to the LoadBalancer. If empty, an ephemeral IP will be created and used (cloud-provider specific).

    --name='':
        The name for the newly created object.

    -o, --output='':
        Output format. One of: (json, yaml, name, go-template, go-template-file, template, templatefile, jsonpath, jsonpath-as-json, jsonpath-file).

    --override-type='merge':
        The method used to override the generated object: json, merge, or strategic.

    --overrides='':
        An inline JSON override for the generated object. If this is non-empty, it is used to override the generated object. Requires that the object supply a valid apiVersion field.

    --port='':
        The port that the service should serve on. Copied from the resource being exposed, if unspecified

    --protocol='':
        The network protocol for the service to be created. Default is 'TCP'.

    -R, --recursive=false:
        Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.

    --save-config=false:
        If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.

    --selector='':
        A label selector to use for this service. Only equality-based selector requirements are supported. If empty (the default) infer the selector from the replication controller or replica set.)

    --session-affinity='':
        If non-empty, set the session affinity for the service to this; legal values: 'None', 'ClientIP'

    --show-managed-fields=false:
        If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.

    --target-port='':
        Name or number for the port on the container that the service should direct traffic to. Optional.

    --template='':
        Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].

    --type='':
        Type for this service: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, or ExternalName. Default is 'ClusterIP'.
```

Usage:
```sh
  kubectl expose (-f FILENAME | TYPE NAME) [--port=port] [--protocol=TCP|UDP|SCTP] [--target-port=number-or-name] [--name=name] [--external-ip=external-ip-of-service] [--type=type] [options]
```

WITH ALL THIS, YOU CAN CREATE RESOURCES IMPERATIVELY, Pick all the essential options and the workload objects to create the same. 

**LETS CREATE A RESOURCE IMPERATIVELY, as we did declaratively:** from the example given here, need to create an **`svc`** with 80 port number with a  running`deployment` object by using a `selector` with the PODs respective labels, (took one from the examples and additionally added `selector`)

to check the labels given below,
```sh
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide --show-labels
```
```sh
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=nOfsvc --target-port=nOfTarget --selector=labels
```

```sh
kubectl expose deployment deployName --port=8000 --target-port=80 --selector=app=nginx-app --name=nameOfsvc
```
if labels matched, the `svc`'s endpoints will match with the PODs in ease. 
```sh
kubectl get svc,deploy,rs,po -o wide
curl svcIP:port
```

From this, we have understood that, can create our `svc` of any type using imperative approach. 

*clear and cleanup.*
