# 14. Â Advanced: Traffic flow from external to node to service to POD
Advanced Traffic flow from external to node to service to POD - [Doc]

![[Nodeport-workflow.excalidraw]]

Nothing new, just as same as the one we saw earlier. 

Now, will understand how the traffic flows from getting that 
**`External Traffic`** all the way back to the **`backend PODs`** using this **NodePort** `svc` type. Will see all that by explaining each.

![[Nodeport-workflow-brief.excalidraw]]

Here: 
**GET:**
- External Client  -> make requests to `192.168.0.123:nodePort` (to **node1**)
- The **Node1**'s IP is **192.168.0.123**, 
- The **Node2's IP is 192.168.0.124**, 
- To access, we can use any one of the IP addresses though.
- External Traffic/`src` -- GET req --> `kube-proxy` ----->  `dest`/TargetPODs
- GET action contains `src` as client, `dest` as target -> goes to `kube-proxy` 
- `kube-proxy` resolves it  by applying NAT. 
- `kube-proxy`-> forwards the GET action request to `src` as **Node1**, `dest` as **TargetPODs**.
**POST:**
- now in response POST action, TargetPODs responses
- That POST packet contains `src` as **TargetPODs**, `dest` as **Node1**
- After that POST gets to Node1's `kube-proxy` 
- `kube-proxy` resolves it by reversing the NAT. 
- `kube-proxy`-> forwards the POST action request to `src` as back to **Node1**, `dest` back to **client**.
But in a direct overview, Client -> Node1's `kube-proxy` -> DNAT(for GET)/reverseDNAT(for POST) -> TargetPods/
