# 10. NodePort service: Introduction
**NodePort** `svc` Introduction - [Doc]

We have seen the **ClusterIP** svc type. Now will cover another `svc` type which is **NodePort** `svc` type.

Will dive in deep of **NodePort** `svc` type:

EXPOSING THE APPLICATION OUTSIDE K8s CLUSTER by opening up the PORTs, If external traffic wants to talk to the resources inside K8s Cluster via PORTs with the one called **NodeIP Address** = NodeIP address + NodePort (both control plane and worker nodes) - **NodePort**

Traffic -> NodeIP+Port -> `kube-proxy` backed `svc` -> resolves the **src** and **dst** target PODs and does back the same. 

>**Within the Cluster, would've used `ClusterIP`.** (can't access from outside since it is private) 
**Outside Cluster, `NodePort`**

Will dig deep into each key points of `NodePort`
**NodePort svc Architecture:** (nodeService:enp0s3)
![[svc-nodeport.excalidraw]]
- In order to expose **service** on `each node` to external traffic using fixed port of nodes in the cluster
- `Workflow`: External traffic -> NodePort -> **Service** (ClusterIP) -> POD
- While creating **service** object, we need to specify type: NodePort
- By default, K8s allocated default **NodePort** from `30000 to 32767`
- we can check the NodePort assigned to the service under .spec.ports[*].nodePort=32170
- In order to set custom IP address for NodePort service, we need to define `--nodeport-address` flag for `kube-proxy` process or `kube-proxy` config file (`nodePortAddress`)
- With this `NodePort` **Service**, we need to open the firewall on the nodes if enabled, unnecessarily even POD is not running on that node. 

###### In order to expose **service** on `each node` to external traffic using fixed port of nodes in the cluster.
accessing K8s Cluster from outside - NodePort

previously we have seen about `hostname and IP` in order to identify or assess PODs. Here, we have something known as **Node Group**. 

Even if there are no PODs running on, the **NodeIP** and the **NodePort** will be open and available still even without resources. Will see how it gets assigned and see both the pros and cons of the same. 

###### `Workflow`: External traffic -> NodePort -> **Service** (ClusterIP) -> POD

External Traffic with the PORT number -> NodePort -> **Service** (ClusterIP) -> Backend dst Target POD.
> Node -> svc -> POD. 

###### While creating **service** object, we need to specify `type: NodePort`
 
While creating **service** object, we need to specify `type: NodePort` whether Imperatively or declaratively, should be defining `svc`:
```sh
type: NodePort
```
without defining, it'll proceed with the default `clusterIP`.


###### By default, K8s allocated default **NodePort** from `30000 to 32767`
NodePort's Port range series: 30000 to 32767 for a K8s Cluster. Also we can extend the same if required by specific methods. Will cover the same. 
If you are defining and assigning a Port Number to a resource means, 0


###### we can check the NodePort assigned to the service under *.spec.ports[*]*.nodePort=32170*
we can check the same NodePort assigned to the `svc` under, in order to specify port,
`.spec.ports[*].nodePort= nPortNumber`

###### In order to set custom IP address for NodePort service, we need to define `--nodeport-address` flag for `kube-proxy` process or `kube-proxy` config file (`nodePortAddress`)

In order to set custom IP address which is **NodeIP** address  for **NodePort** service(`enp0s3`), need to define 
```sh
--nodeport-address
```
flag for `kube-proxy` process or `kube-proxy` config file.

eg: the interface of Node`svc` via multiple ways to be such as to be exposed to see the Interface to interact with the application(any node), such as 
- Loopback Interface - **localhost**
- enp0s3
- or other interface
can listen to any of these. 

Now we have to bind this `NodeIP` interface to the `kube-proxy`.  to define that: `--node-port-address`. 
define `--nodeport-address` flag for `kube-proxy` process or `kube-proxy` config file.
>Simply binding the **NodeIP** to an interface. 

eg: if the nodePort is some `NodeIP` and the Loopback localhost is `127.0.0.1`, 
*Will be binding the `kube-proxy` only to the `loopback localhost` or `other Interface`*. This gets resolved within the cluster but exposed just the application out to the public. 
`svcNodeIP+Port`


###### With this `NodePort` **Service**, we need to open the firewall on the nodes if enabled, unnecessarily even POD is not running on that node. 
Basic and obvious point. Should open up the port in firewall if restricted. 

With this `NodePort` **Service**, we need to open the firewall on the nodes if enabled, unnecessarily even POD is not running on that node. 

Will understand the same in deep by practicing the same.
