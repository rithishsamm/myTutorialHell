# 12. Service NodePort type creation using Imperative approach
Service NodePort type creation using Imperative approach - [Doc]

Doing everything we have seen above but in imperative approach, we cleanup and redeploy all to work with the same. 

apply the `deploy` object manifest and will create an `svc` for it imperatively,
```sh
kubectl create -f path/to/deploy.yaml
```
```sh
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide --show-labels
```

based on these resources labels, we will be creating an `svc` to all the target PODs imperatively,
```sh
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deploy --port=8090 --target-port=80 --selector=app=nginx --type=NodePort --name=nginx-svc
```
```sh
kubectl get svc -o wide
```

check if it's working,
```sh
curl nodemachine/VMip:nodeport
```
catch is, **cannot allocate specific port for it to be exposed.**  like we do it declaratively in `nodePort` parameter.

cleanup
```sh
kubectl delete svcName
```
