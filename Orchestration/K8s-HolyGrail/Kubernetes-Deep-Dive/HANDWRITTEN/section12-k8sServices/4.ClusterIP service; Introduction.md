# 4. Â Cluster IP service: Introduction

**ClusterIP Service: Introduction**
In services, first and default one covering `ClusterIP`. (is the default type in service.)

![[svc.excalidraw]]

WILL RECAP THE SAME TO REFER `ClusterIP`,
>  Service `svc` type:  ==**ClusterIP**==
- It's a default **Service** `svc` type, if no type value passed while creating **service**
- **Service** create a **VIP (`virtualIP`) address** which will be accessible within the cluster
- Every **Service** `svc` has its own `DNS` and `ClusterIP`
- In K8s, `kube-proxy` is responsible for **VIP mechanism** for **Service** `svc` (Except: `ExternalName` **service** type)
- Modes offered in `kube-proxy`:
1) `iptables(default)`
2) **IPVS** (low latency, higher throughput and better performance)
3) **userspace** (legacy mode, not recommended anymore)
4) Execute cmd:
```sh
curl http://localhost:10249/{proxyMode, healthz, health, metrics}
```
- `kube-proxy` supports session `affinity` and `stickness timeout`
1) `.spec.sessionAffinty` (`ClusterIP` and none)
2) `.spec.sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP.timeoutSeconds(Default: 10800)` (which is 3hrs)
3) Not supported in **Windows**

as we referred the diagram previously, 
![[svc.excalidraw]]

###### It's a default **Service** `svc` type, if no type value passed while creating **service**
**`ClusterIP` is the default service type in K8s.**  
Even if you didn't declare any service types in the manifest, goes with the default `ClusterIP`. 

###### **Service** create a **VIP (`virtualIP`) address** which will be accessible within the cluster
Since we mention that a service contains of a `VIP` Virtual private address and a `dns name`, which helps to be accessible within the cluster. 

If we create a service, it will have a `dns name` and `VIP` for itself. To be accessible inside the cluster either you are in control plane or in compute plane node. 

THIS CANNOT BE ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE THE CLUSTER SINCE IT IS A **VIRTUAL PRIVATE IP** can be accessible only in private. 

NOTE TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN WE ARE WORKING WITH **Service** `svc`

###### Every **Service** `svc` has its own `DNS` and `ClusterIP`
Every **Service** `svc` has its own `DNS` and `ClusterIP`
use any one of them to use the `backend` PODs using `LB`. 

###### In K8s, `kube-proxy` is responsible for **VIP mechanism** for **Service** `svc` (Except: `ExternalName` **service** type)
Most important factor. 
In K8s, we have `kube-proxy`. IS THE MAIN CHARACTER.==The actual component who is responsible for sending all the traffic to the `backend` PODs.==

IF CoreDNS takes care of assigning `dns name` to the `svc`, `kube-proxy` does the same for the `VIP`. 

request sent to the `svc`,  `kube-proxy` managed VIP for the `svc` takes care of the rest. Not just the ClusterIP. 

> `kube-proxy` - takes care of distributing and  sending back the traffic. 

*BUT THIS MECHANISM DOESN'T APPLY FOR `ExternalName` service type.  
**that way, we have different modes in `kube-proxy`,**


###### Modes offered in `kube-proxy`:
- iptables
- IPVS
- userspace
**important to understand `kube-proxy` modes as a K8s Administrator.** 
since `kube-proxy` - takes care of the responsibility of distributing and  sending back the traffic from `svc` to `backend` PODs.  

1) **`iptables(default)`**
default mode of `kube-proxy`. less than 1000's of svc's, this mode is enough. 

2) **IPVS** (low latency, higher throughput and better performance)
for specialized use cases shines in HA type of workloads and for large scale applications, such as having more than 1000s of `svc`'s to manage the application,  offering low latency, higher throughput and better performance)

3) **userspace** 
legacy. old and deprecated. not recommended anymore. high latency, poor performance. 

**Execute cmd:**
```sh
curl http://localhost:10249/{proxyMode, healthz, health, metrics}
```
-> this command talks to `kube-proxy` and that fetches back all the data such as proxyMode, healthz, health, metrics. 


###### `kube-proxy` supports `session affinity` and `stickiness timeout`
1) `.spec.sessionAffinty` (`ClusterIP` and none)
2) `.spec.sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP.timeoutSeconds(Default: 10800)` (which is 3hrs) and its not supported in **Windows**

need to talk about this, the purpose and use of this. `kube-proxy` supports session `affinity` and `stickness timeout`

LETS SAY, 
we have a clientPOD (which can be an application running inside a cluster, outside K8s cluster or just a simple user). 

AND You will send requests to the services `svc` an `LB` for in case in order to reach out to the PODs. 

###### 1. session affinity
**`.spec.sessionAffinty` (`ClusterIP` and none)**
clientPOD -- req ->  `svc` -> PODs and here, the clientPOD sedning another request,
clientPOD1 -- req1 ->  `svc` -> PODs -> IF I WANT TO SEND THAT SAME ANOTHER REQUEST FROM THE SAME clientPOD TO THE SAME POD. (for particular reasons)
for such cases, we need to use  `Session affinity` as `ClusterIP`.
means if i want to send request to the same POD in the backend of the `svc` - `Session affinity`=`ClusterIP`. 

if not so bothered about such, DISTRIBUTING REQUESTS TO DIFFERENT PODs are okay means, `svc` - `Session affinity`=`none`  - DEFAULT for `svc`'s `session affinity`

###### 2. stickiness timeout 
**`.spec.sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP.timeoutSeconds(Default: 10800)` (which is 3hrs)**
 
in order to enable `stickiness timeout`,  **`.spec.sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP.timeoutSeconds = nInSecs`  (Default: 10800 which is 3hrs)**
 a session timeout of a clientPOD to one particular request and following to the PODs. and this feature available only on linux, not on windows. 

THIS PROXY MODES (`iptables`, `ipvs`, `userspace`) APPLIES TO ALL THE `SVC`s. Will get more of `ClusterIP` and cover more of what is `dns name` `clusterIP` **VIP** and all,
