# Section 15: K8s StatefulSet

# 1.  Introduction to StatefulSet Object
Introduction to StatefulSet Object - [Doc]

Before diving all in `StatefulSet - STS` workload resource object, there are prerequisites to understand StatefulSet in brief,

- Workload Resource (Except STS since we had to cover the prerequisites expecially service to understand STS),
- Service (Except Headless, same excuse applies to understand STS),
- Persistent Volume (PVs and its workings, plugins that supports, reclaim policy, phases and access modes are essential to understand STS in brief) 
- Persistent Volume Claim (Seen static and but dynamic PVC is so important for STS) yet to cover,

Will see in brief about StatefulSet workload objects, why it is used, what is the purpose, core functionalities, when to use **StatefulSet object** for our application deployment on K 8 s Cluster, 

Again before this, lets understand what is Stateless objects and applications before understanding what is Stateful objects, 

##### StatefulSet vs Stateless:
Lets say, we deploy applications using Deployment object with 3 replicas. (which is a stateless workload object), 

**Can you able to predict the PODs name??? Little to no chance!** - PODs created by RC, RS, Deploy workload objects - the names will be dynamic, it keeps on changing whenever it goes down and re-spawns. Can't predict before getting deployed, 

In terms of `STS` StatefulSet, it matters. 

Challenges with Stateless Applications and how StatefulSet satifies all that:
Challenge 1 - 
Challenge 2 - 
Challenge 3 - 

- In order to run **StatefulSet applications** on k8s cluster, we need to use StatefulSet workload objects,
- We can scaleIn, scaleOut, rollout and rollback StatefulSet Object,
- In order to create/delete PODs in proper order and to main uniqueness, we use StatefulSet,
- Workflow: StatefulSet -> POD 
- For Stateless applications, it is recommended to use Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication Controller, DaemonSet and such
- For StatefulSet applications, we need to use StatefulSet object,
- Every POD that is created under to be continued!
