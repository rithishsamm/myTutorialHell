# Section 15: K8s StatefulSet

# 1.  Introduction to StatefulSet Object
Introduction to StatefulSet Object - [Doc]

Before diving all in `StatefulSet - STS` workload resource object, there are prerequisites to understand StatefulSet in brief,

- Workload Resource (Except STS since we had to cover the prerequisites expecially service to understand STS),
- Service (Except Headless, same excuse applies to understand STS),
- Persistent Volume (PVs and its workings, plugins that supports, reclaim policy, phases and access modes are essential to understand STS in brief) 
- Persistent Volume Claim (Seen static and but dynamic PVC is so important for STS) yet to cover,

Will see in brief about StatefulSet workload objects, why it is used, what is the purpose, core functionalities, when to use **StatefulSet object** for our application deployment on K 8 s Cluster, 

Again before this, lets understand what is Stateless objects and applications before understanding what is Stateful objects, 

##### StatefulSet vs Stateless:
Lets say, we deploy applications using Deployment object with 3 replicas. (which is a stateless workload object), 

**Can you able to predict the PODs name??? Little to no chance!** - PODs created by RC, RS, Deploy workload objects - the names will be dynamic, it keeps on changing whenever it goes down and re-spawns. Can't predict before getting deployed, 

In terms of `STS` StatefulSet, it matters. 

Challenges with Stateless Applications and how StatefulSet satisfies all that:
Challenge 1 - 
Challenge 2 - 
Challenge 3 -

### StatefulSet (STS) 
- In order to run **StatefulSet applications** on K8s cluster, we need to use StatefulSet workload objects,
- We can **scaleIn, scaleOut, rollout and rollback** StatefulSet Object,
- In order to create/delete PODs in proper order and to main uniqueness, we use StatefulSet,
- **Workflow**: StatefulSet -> POD
- For **Stateless applications**, it is recommended to use `Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication Controller, DaemonSet and such`
- For **`StatefulSet` applications**, we need to use `StatefulSet` object,
- Every POD that is created under `StatefulSet` will have stranded naming convention like `<sts-name>-<index>`
- One of the main reason for using StatefulSet is to provide **persistent storage volumes** for workloads. 
- Use cases for application deployment using `StatefulSet`:
	- Stable, unique network identifiers
	- Stable, persistent storage
	- Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling
	- Ordered, automated rolling updates
- Limitations:
	- PV should be provisioned by **`StorageClass`** or by **Administrator**
	- Deleting `StatefulSet`, will not delete volumes associated 
	- StatefulSet required/recommended to use only Service type as Headless (`ClusterIP: None`)
- `STS` update strategies: **`RollingUpdate`** (default) and **`OnDelete`**
- `StatefulSet` uses **`volumeClaimTemplates`** to create dynamic PVC Object.
