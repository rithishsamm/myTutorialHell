# Section 11: K8S Auto cleanup
# 1.  Introduction to Auto-cleanup of finished Jobs
> K8s Workload Resource:  ==**Auto Cleanup**== for finished jobs,

We have already seen some about cleanup

manually removing resources by passing,
```sh
kubectl delete cj,job cj/jobName
```

or using `ttl` means `time-to-live`works under `.spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished`
passing the `ttl` parameter in the manifest as,
```sh
ttlSecondsAfterFinished: nSecs
```

By passing this, the `kub-controllermanager` will take the responsibility of cleaning up all the finished jobs. either standalone `jobs` or `cronjobs` in order to clean up those stuff. 

THIS IS A RECAP OF THE SAME.
