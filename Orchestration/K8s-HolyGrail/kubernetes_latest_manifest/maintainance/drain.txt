Drain:
======

You can use kubectl drain to safely evict all of your pods from a node before you perform maintenance 
on the node (e.g. kernel upgrade, hardware maintenance, etc.). Safe evictions allow the podâ€™s containers 
to gracefully terminate and will respect the PodDisruptionBudgets you have specified.


Now to drain the node, execute below command:

#kubernetes drain node <nodename>
