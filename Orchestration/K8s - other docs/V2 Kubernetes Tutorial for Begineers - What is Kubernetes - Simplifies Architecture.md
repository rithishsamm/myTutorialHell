#### Notes:

Context: 
1) Kubernetes 101, 
2) How it is started
3) Architecture 
4) How to use it,
5) Installation 
6) Problem Statement
7) Features
8) Terminologies 
9) Hands-on demo

###### **Introduction**
hey everyone welcome back to another video and in this video we are starting
a complete kubernetes course from scratch no prerequisites whatsoever
about kubernetes are required by doing the complete devops with kubernetes 

if you don't know anything about kubernetes this video is for you we'll cover everything like how it started the architecture how you can use it so like the installation what problems it's solving the features various terminologies and hands-on demos as well 

if you don't know anything about K8's by the end of this video you will know a lot right so in every video that i make on my channel you can find so many tutorials i i make

sure that i am explaining things in such a way that even a person who has never heard about that thing so if you have never even heard the name kubernetes you will be able to understand this video very easily all right.

##### **Why do we use Docker?**

in the previous docker video i mentioned like why we're using docker right and uh 

what used to happen before like they were like you know if you want to start a new application for example so in the previous previous days you had to get servers you had to buy servers right and you install a server and then you put your application in it and your company is like hey we need more more applications running you're like okay let's buy new servers add applications onto it and whatsoever okay so it became really difficult it became really cost yiu know consuming and time consuming and uh 

developers were focusing on development like building the application building their project website apps or whatever and the people installing and managing these servers and stuff they were responsible

for sort of like uh you know running applications on this so sys admins for example they were extremely crucial in handling these servers is basically what i'm saying so in the docker video, we learned about this in the docker video

we also saw that then we got something like uh you know virtual machines so in the virtual machine part we saw that uh now you can uh divide your space and allocate resources and cpu and memory usage to fl to like virtual machines okay so you can divide your hard disk for example install

another operating system of that that will act like like a separate machine so in one server you are having many many machines that's why it's called virtual
machine this way you don't have to buy new servers you can just use that server, only as different different machines but

this was also not cool and then we learned about containers right so containers basically say okay you will run your applications in such a way that your application is out isolated from the outside world but the very awesome thing is that you would not have to install a new operating system allocate resources to it or whatever things like that it will run on the host operating system only using some container engine .
##### Configuration management

**configuration management**: configuration management
so this basically means that you can maintain all the changes in your infrastructure with the help of software.

okay so for example, uh you know you have ansible and stuff. so basically you can uh provide a state like hey i want my infrastructure to run like this and like that this much ram should be allocated this much that should be allocated 

but in the previous wave like before virtual machines we used to have like these racks of servers and stuff right so the configuration management tools
were like built for these 

but then came into picture virtual machines the virtual machine was like that we are offering you dynamic infrastructure like you can scale up or down or divide your resources in the same same server okay so what they told was that okay uh if you're running like you know stuff on on virtual machines then when you have your configuration let's say installed or whatever you're running our desired state you're like okay i'm running this application like this and

like that it's running people are using that and i'm going to make changes to that application that image that is you know let's say container that is running so it's not like you can change the container at runtime uh these uh particular uh you know um configuration managements were first like they were mutable like you could change those but now it's like it's immutable so for example if it's already running like container running can't change that if you want to make some changes you can start up a new virtual machine for example okay so it' provided immutability which is important because this will

when we talk about like containers you want to start new container you want to add a new version of your application okay stop the previous containers and start new containers so at run time you cannot make changes as such and this is how the modern infrastructure works 

okay so now you know there are so many cloud hosting platforms right the cevo there's aws google cloud azure digitalocean line node so on and so forth so many cloud hosting platforms so you can run your own applications in the cloud and all these other things they offer like humanities services and all these other things as well so managing the modern infrastructure it's based on immutability you want to make some changes to like the virtual machine stuff you want to update your application previous ones will go down new ones will come up okay 

stuff like you know chef, puppet so on and so forth all right so these are basically infrastructure as code principles so it's very simple.

okay basically writing your uh configuration about your server in a file and like saying that okay i want my server to be like this and like that okay done

so a little it of history previously it was mutable like you can make the changes to your running bare metal like servers that were running that you know before virtual machines when virtual machines came they were like okay now i have like as many stuff as i can create because in when before like during virtual machines 

also what happened was that um like an application that requires let's say two gigabytes of ram but the virtual machine is allocated 10 gigabytes of memory eight gigabytes is wasted for example right so immutability basically meant that it is offering some reliability as compared to your previous um you know before virtual machine scenario so it offers reliability and it was also much more um

you know better in terms of like uh securities and stuff so you cannot run the you cannot change anything that is already running if a virtual machine is running then you cannot change that if you want to make some changes you have to create a new virtual machine

let's say make some updates to your applications and whatever okay but with configuration management tools like they are providing like okay i can now make you know specify some things that i want i want a virtual machine to be running with this much amount of memories i give that file and the server will start that the problem is that what if like in a server you are running multiple multiple services in one server some is requiring 

let's say uh python two some is requiring python three or whatever let's just giving an example so one service like there are many services running uh of same type but requiring different versions different versions are being required so what do you do in a release you just say make a folder zip that and share that as a release manually copy files and whatever are able to understand so you may have heard about in development - package managers

package managers previously there were no package managers and this was the issue with that okay like what if one application is running and you want to have like it's one one particular app is a service is asking for python two another was asking for python three it's all running on one server so which one it's like so hard to manage right so then came into picture like okay what we need to do is we we don't need to have a separate virtual machine for every service that we are running are you able to understand like just just servers okay virtual machine so separate virtual machine can run every single application you're like okay no i don't want to do that okay i don't want to do that i can instead have containers okay 

so then came into picture containers. so using containers you can spin up containers like that uh all the you know things that you can bundle the version and modules os and everything you can get a docker image or whatever deploy it and it can run on servers and whatever very simply 
**MUTABILITY**

**IMMUTABILITY**

Will see more about managing containers in brief efficiently~~

##### Managing containers

monolithic application. It is very simple so monolithic architecture basically means that you have let's say talk about a website okay what do we have in a website 

what do we have in our website we have the front end + the back end and we have let's say some + messaging chat application or something and we have + a database for example right and 

we have some networking components for example okay so five components we are having in a particular web application, simple web application if you bundle this as a single application, all the code has a single application

what do you mean bundle as a single application what do we mean bundle bundle basically means like in simple language deploy it as one application okay

in your container just deploy it as one application in your container only everything will be running front and back and chat app in one container database everything running in just bundle together as one application
-- this is known as monolithic application.

okay it's very easy to deploy you don't have to do anything just just single simply deploy it and only one thing is running okay and uh since it's everything is deployed as once 

PROBLEM IS if you want to make any changes let's say in database you have to deploy everything entirely again you want to make any changes into networking code you have to make changes in networking code deploy all the things again

because all the things are together

okay here was a little bit this was a problem okay you're gonna make little
bit of changes in the back end you have to deploy front-end back-end chat database and networking all together at once

okay if you want to scale front-end you would have to scale back-end also let's say my front-end my application this entire application is running right now on three servers you want to put it on 10 servers you want the front end to be only on 10 servers you don't want all these other applications on 10 servers but these are one application it's bundled together so if you want to scale front end it will automatically have to scale all these other applications also okay so this is not a very good design this is not a very good design

so these are this is basically what we call um monolithic application

###### ***Monolithic applications** (answer)*
 
 **MICROSERVICES:**
![[Screenshot 2024-03-12 165659.png]]
 okay so how do we solve this problem **micro services** 
 
 Very very important term we'll be playing with micro services a lot on this youtube channel okay micro services.
 
 micro services very simple as the name suggests now basically the idea is that instead of deploying it as a single application all of these components are deployed as individual applications front-end back-end chart 

front-end this is simple. different application okay deployed differently. uh back-end, database and messages, what else did we have networking components.

how cool is that?

all the problems we were having now for example you want to make any change in front end you're like let's say this is running on server number three this is running on server number two this is also running server just in an example point of view okay don't quote me on this server number one so you want to make changes to front-end you will only change change this front-end application that is running rather than all these applications that are running you want to scale front-end you want to have 10 000 applications of front-end and only 5000 applications of back-end and 8000 applications running of  databases or 8 000 containers running of databases right that is totally cool 

now you can do that since this is running in its own container this is running it's in its own container this is running it's in its own container okay and the previous thing that i mentioned the lack of package managers like all these things like dependencies and whatever that is being sold now with docker

that is being sold now with docker every container has no idea what's going on outside it it's running on its own okay so please have a clear understanding of this history bare metal servers virtual machines containers monolithic micro services and uh

this configuration management tools and how that worked with mutability and immutability very nice summary i gave you just now cool

but the problem here was that uh obviously we are solving some of the
problems like 
- how are we going to run these so at so many other places or
whatever so containers 
- you can use containers and 
- run your micro services inside containers 
- you can scale those independently and all these other things you can do okay 
- you can make change in one application rather affecting with other application this is also called uh **fault isolation**

 i can make changes in the front end code you can have some people working on this code some people working on this course you know teams can also be divided right teams can also work on their own but the problem is how to manage how to manage because if these applications are running separately obviously it is all a part of one application only right theoretically so they would have to communicate with each othe. they would have to communicate with each other right so how to manage this how do they communicate with each other, since you're running 10 000 services so that can become a very complex graph right this application topping to this application or whatever

that can be very complex okay some of he tools like there's also something

known as you know later on we'll look at service meshes

uh

uh i am actually having a

like this now okay

service mesh later on

cool

so you're looking at service messages in

the future cool so i believe you have

this understanding about virtual

machines and containers now that virtual

machine one you know

one application

on

one

virtual machine

this is not cool

for

scaling

hence

docker that's as simple as that

okay all right so we have looked at a

bunch of things now the next part
**Pros**: 

**Cons**:


**HOW TO SOLVE ALL THESE COMPLEXITIES:**
+
**HOW TO MICROSERVICE:**

##### Orchestrators (scaling applications)


scaling these applications right so um

let's say you have so many containers

that are running okay talked about micro

services your micro services individual

applications running inside containers

or whatever they are running so so

nicely and let's say you you your

website is running uh 100 containers now

some more people start using your

website so the server load increases

right you want to have more and more uh

instances of your applications now

you're like okay create more

applications and distribute the load

over the servers okay something like

that um so how would you do that you can

do that you know like just one command

and just start

all these other things and what you can

do is one more one problem you may face

is you want

let's say you're running 1000 containers

and

200 containers get damaged or something

you want to restart those so that's also

another problem let's say you have

something like um you you want to make

updates to your application version one

is running you want to have version two

updated so what do you do would you stop

all the things make the update then

start your services then your customers

will be mad right they'll be like okay

what is happening why is the application

down so folks often want to update the

application while it's running okay so

rolling updates or like rollbacks with

zero downtime okay

and scale it up and down accordingly and

also deploy your applications for

example so

how can we do that comes into picture

orchestrators

orcas traitor so orchestrator basically

helps us in deploying and managing

applications

okay

dynamically

[Music]

deploying

and managing applications dynamically

dynamically means like on its own with

the use case that is provided more

people are using scale up the

application some things went down then

restart it heal the containers or

whatever okay managing

containers

dynamically

kubernetes helps us in doing this

okay so you can deploy or please make

notes on your own okay you can deploy

your application

you can

zero downtime

updates

and scale

your application

right

and you can

heal containers when some containers go

down or whatever you can restart those

containers so many other things

okay

and kubernetes helps us in doing this

and by the way these are all also

features of cloud native applications

cloud native applications i'll dive deep

into humanities obviously but try to

understand what orchestrators are for

example like if you have um you know you

have the the orchestra where someone is

playing trumpet someone is playing the

drum and whatever and they're this

person who is the orchestrator or

whatever they are doing like this in the

music hall

so it's like managing everyone okay that

that person doing this this is cuban it

is and orchestrate and those people who

are

running like uh

playing trumpets and drums and guitar

and whatever they are micro services

okay so kubernetes is managing the

microservices okay so if someone asks

you now what is the difference between

like what is cloud native is it same as

like cloud computing or whatever

no it's a different thing cloud native

basically means the cloud native

applications

that can you know run modern business uh

uh

in the modern business how the modern

business functions and meet the modern

business demands for example right now

what are those demands these are the

demands deploy zero downtime updates

scale he'll heal the self healing for

example

self healing

applications that follow all these

principles and applications that can run

on top of kubernetes that is the most

important point these are known as cloud

native applications

okay

it's different than like cloud computing

cloud computing means you're taking some

uh you know resources from some cloud

provider like ram or server or whatever

definitely cloud native applications can

run on these cloud computing platforms

also

okay it can run in your local system

also

anywhere you have kubernetes you can run

cloud native applications

hope you're able to understand what

cloud native is okay

application cloud native applications

applications that are designed to meet

these requirements are called cloud

native applications okay so this will

also make uh make sense now that uh

running containers directly like that

it's a bad idea

okay no one is like running just

containers as it is they're using some

orchestration tools some scheduling

tools and kubernetes provides that

okay scheduler basically means that

schedules all these little containers

and manages all these things okay so

these are some like uh

some of the benefits right so when we

talk about kubernetes it has schedulers

and basically it's uh makes sure

scheduler is basically something that

makes sure like okay canal you told me

that five applications should be running

uh always five applications will be

running if one goes down i will restart

it scheduler takes care of that so it's

like okay now you mentioned only two

gigabytes of ram should be allocated to

this application sure i will take care

of that okay so it will make sure like

all these fault tolerance and you know

like the high availability and

self-healing stuff that takes

into picture okay so

cool okay so that's basically what cuban

it is is i'll talk more about the

features how it started and everything

we haven't even touched upon kids right

now i've just mentioned what

orchestrators are and kubernetes

provides us in such a way so for example

you can say that hey um you can tell it

you know like what we want it to do

rather than how to do it okay so you

don't care how it does it so like hey

cuban it is run this application uh this

website application on two servers okay

behind it okay and allocate this much

memory to it how it will do it that's up

to q when it is you just provide it via

an api

okay kubernetes api and i'll tell you

about that api in just a minute when we

do hands-on coding and how i will

actually you know use kubernetes in this

video itself schedule some containers

and all these things that we are

mentioning okay so

that's basically it that's you know

kubernetes allows us to you know do all

these other things and if applications

are like going down communities will

help you know

get those restarted you can deploy

applications with zero downtime updates

scale those applications self heal these

containers and it also provides a lot of

amazing features okay an application

that is running you can duplicate and

replicate replicate that application it

also offers like load balancing services

and everything

##### Introduction to Kubernetes
 so orchestration provides

these features

okay but cuban it is on top of that

also provides some additional features

so can we say that kubernetes is much

more than a container orchestrator

yes

so this is an important point someone

asks you what is cuban it is you should

not say it's a container orchestrator no

it is much more than that

okay you can run it on your own cloud

write down these points that i'm saying

so

you can um you know for example uh

run it on your own cloud or some you

know on your own machine or outside you

know in the public public cloud

providers as well right

and uh you can migrate it so you can

migrate from one you know one provider

to another provider you can also um

you know um

when you're talking about like services

or communities can replicate those and

uh you know scale those and like put

those on like uh

dedicated like like servers and stuff

and uh the the zero downtime deployment

stuff and fault tolerance and self

healing of clusters and everything that

is mentioned over here you can also use

volumes with it so that's also at some

additional you can use volumes right

some external hard disks or whatever

external external storage it also

provides load balancing right for

requests and stuff and you can access

logs and then there's service discovery

and all these other things you can also

store uh you can also store um

what's it called the secret information

like password and stuff using secrets

for example right so so many things that

i mentioned that is much more than

orchestration

right it's much more than orchestration

so that is why cuban it is it's

extremely popular and it's much more

than a container orchestrator okay now

let's talk about so you know the

features of kubernetes now or what or

whatever but how it works and the

architecture and everything




##### History of Kubernetes
![[Screenshot 2024-03-12 165807.png]]


we'll look into shortly but before that

let's see how it came into picture it's

a very nice story actually so like um

you know um

what happened was that um

when people were running like uh you

know bare metal like servers and stuff

and all these other things came into

picture aws amazon web services they

changed the game they offered something

known as cloud

so aws

offered

cloud

and everyone lost their mind so people

are like hey this is all fake and cloud

is nothing and everything but aws kept

going and then they

sort of like dominated the market

and then what happened was that um

uh there was obviously some some

competition and uh there was this thing

known as openstack

okay

so openstack was more like an open

source alternative for aws

but uh it did not like work out okay

so

it did not like could not catch up to

like aws aws was already already on a

really large scale

before everything like this was

happening google internally in their own

you know company like they were running

containers and orchestrators on a very

large scale billions and billions of

containers google was running okay they

were using their application

orchestrators on something known as i

believe

borg

okay and omega

so

these are you know people were offering

their own stuff and whatever but google

was running these billions and billions

of containers and orchestrators and

stuff the things that i've just

mentioned above

privately in their own company

okay then what happened was that um

google created kubernetes and the folks

who worked on

bargain omega i believe they created

cuban it is it's not like the same thing

but i believe like since the same people

worked on it maybe like has some sort of

similarity but

don't really know so they donated cuban

it is so

google

made

kubernetes or k8s it's called k8s

because

cuber net is

first letter k last letter s in between

it has eight letters so k it's in short

google made cuban it is open source

in 2014 and donated it to

cncf

cloud native computing foundation shout

out to cncf and also check out cncf

students you want to get involved

contributing to open source it's i

believe the second largest project after

you know linux open source project so

you can contribute to it your non-code

contributions are welcome to make videos

on this like how you can contribute

shadows program and all these other

things uh make sure you check out the

open source cafe playlist i've done some

amazing videos on how you can contribute

to gates that's how cubans came into

picture

okay so it was donated to cncf in 2014

so you can see it's not that old that is

why the number of jobs and opportunities

in this field is

very much i work in the field of

humanities as well and i'm a student and

it's

just amazing like

i love it

cool so many opportunities and the pay

is great as well and everything is

amazing and

exciting technologies and stuff you can

work on kubecon is coming up so shout

out to that

okay so that's sort of like the history

and google donated it and now uh it's

open source so many many maintainers and

stuff people like us and you we

contribute to it okay some people also

say it as an os of the cloud because uh

you just run your app you write your

application for kubernetes you don't

care where it's running then i don't

care if it's running on like aws or

whatever or google cloud or you know you

can also run it on cbo and all these are

all company linord or digital ocean it

doesn't matter like

um you can check out like you can write

your application and then you can deploy

your kh application in various platforms

we'll be using sibo because uh it's

extremely fast

extremely affordable as compared to

other cloud providers and it's just

awesome so

um you can get 250 worth of free credit

make sure you check out links in the

description this is going to be

important in the future because um

because

when we use uh

when we try to work with various

servers you can't install various you

can have you cannot have various servers

on your machine because how much your

resources will be depleted right your

computer is not that fast that's why we

use cloud providers

some students are a little bit annoying

they say oh it's asking me to put my

credit card

dude this is basic knowledge right no

cloud provider will let you access their

resources without a card it's basic

security check

okay because otherwise folks will

you know

misuse the resources you're giving

access to your infrastructure

okay that's why a credit card or you

know like a car that is

it is always required any cloud provider

you go to if you want to learn you would

have to add your card please it's basic

common sense don't ask me weird

questions okay and the name you can talk

about comes from a greek name i believe

helmsman helmsman or something

um so you can you can check it out okay

so it's like the person who's steering

the wheel like in the in the ship and

that's why the logo is also a helm type

ship

i'm wearing a helm hoodie as well we'll

talk more about helm in the helm

tutorial later on so

that's basically about it and in the

docker video i also mentioned that when

we're talking about okay kubernetes is

managing our containers and stuff

##### Docker vs Kubernetes


what is the difference between like

docker and kubernetes then a docker is a

container tool and kubernetes

acts as an orchestrator okay you were

able to use like docker but now it's

like sort of like deprecated why cookie

because

there's a container run time interface

c

r i container runtime interface in the

docker video i told you about container

runtimes container de and all these

other things right and the thing is that

it's like

it's like a like cuban it is allowing

you to use various container runtimes

like container d and stuff and but it

it's not lying like docker now because

it does not comply with the uh you know

the

the standards of this thing okay it

complies with the standards of oci open

container initiative

everything is covered about this in the

previous video of docker it's a very

awesome video and nice nice nice long

in-depth video please check it out okay

so

the docker shim removal stuff that i

mentioned that's basically about it now

you can use um

container d

for example question will be like you

know if docker is not supported in like

humanities or whatever what is what does

it mean that can i not run my docker

like images and stuff no the answer is

like

you can you can definitely do that

answer is open container initiative i've

answered this question in the docker

video does that doesn't make sense to

repeat it again and again so make sure

you check out the docker video

okay but let's move forward and see how

like a little bit more about k-8s like

cuban it is what it is like we've

learned about what it is and let's see

how it works architecture some demo how

to install it how to use it and

some additional tools i will also share

that will make your life extremely easy

when learning kubernetes and also

working in production there's also i

believe a story related to star trek in

star trek there's someone called some

something related to borg

i'm not entirely sure but due to

copyright a claim they were not able to

get that

um

you can google that history yourself

already now important part this is a new

new part in this video which is we are

starting now

##### Terminologies


this is

architecture of cuban it is how cuban it

is works various components and after

this we'll do a demo so you may have in

this part of the video is an important

part so we'll talk about

various terminologies as well that you

may have heard kubernetes cluster

control plane worker nodes cube ctl

pods containers run times so many things

so we'll cover everything what they do

how they communicate with each other

will draw nice nice diagrams explain

everything in an easy to understand

manner by the way if you're liking um if

you like this video make sure you like

uh

share and uh subscribe as well and yeah

let's get started so

kubernetes is you know very complex it

has so many components and everything

but the good thing is that it is

it is very good at abstracting these

things like we only tell it what to do

how it does it internally like it

manages on its own since you're learning

about kubernetes it's important to you

know let's say understand how things are

working

um

yeah

let's get started so when we talk about

terminologies let's talk about the

kubernetes cluster as a whole

talk about cubanet is cluster

cluster

kubernetes cluster
