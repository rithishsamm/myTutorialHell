Description:
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that enables the operation of an elastic web server framework for cloud applications. Kubernetes can support data center outsourcing to public cloud service providers or can be used for web hosting at scale. 

Docker is a platform and tool for building, distributing and running Docker containers. ... Kubernetes is a container orchestration system for Docker containers that is more extensive than Docker Swarm and is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner

##### **What is Kubernetes:**
a platform and a **container orchestration tool** that **automates deployments**, **scaling** OTA and the ops of application containers effectively.

A robust tool that takes care of production in ease in the microservices architecture.
-> Supports and powered by Docker, Containerd, CRI-O and other subsidiary tech such as Kata containers (formerly Clear and Hyper) and Virtlet (QCOW2) 
Handling one or more images in ease.
#####  Features of Kubernetes

1) Automate various manual mundane tasks, process and controls the server provisioning, hosting, launching, deploying and all the server administration part.
2) Manages Containers, offers security, networking and storage services
3)  It monitors and continuously checks the health of nodes and containers.
