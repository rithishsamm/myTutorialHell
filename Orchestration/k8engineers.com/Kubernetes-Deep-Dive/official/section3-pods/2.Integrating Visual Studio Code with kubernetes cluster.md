In the oracle virtual box, we have set up the single node kubernetes cluster. Let us start the virtual machine and to have remote access to login to the remote machine from the base machine, here we are using visual studio code as the remote machine.

Login to the virtual machine by providing username and password.

To install a visual studio application on your machine, Go to any browser search for VS code download and install the application by clicking on the official link https://code.visualstudio.com.

Depending on the base machine operating system, download the application.

As a virtual machine is a server edition, we cannot install vs code in it. In order to write and execute yaml files in kubernetes, initially we will write those files in the VS code and then they will run in the virtual machine where kubernetes is pre installed. For supporting remote access phenomenon from vs code to the virtual machine, we need to install some of the plugins in the vs code which are namely Remote-SSH, Remote Explorer and Remote-SSH: Editing configuration files. These can be found by searching on the left side of the vs code dashboard.

VSCode -> Extns -> Remote ssh> Connect to host -> ssh username@ip -> Work!
