Behind the scenes, to understand how the pod is getting created? There is a necessity to go through the underlying mechanism of pod creation.

When we try to create a pod using an imperative or declarative approach, we execute a kubectl command for pod creation, it will pass the information to the API server and from there etcd will be verified for the resource availability. If the resource does not exist, etcd will store the information sent by the API server and if exist, once the acknowledgement is received by the etcd to the API server, Now the kube scheduler will decide to launch the pod on the suitable node by undergoing few algorithm verifications. After the decision it will take the response back to the API server and also this response is stored in the etcd. Hence there is no possibility of communication in between the scheduler and etcd.

Thus the API server will decide to launch the pod on any one of the compute plane node then send the information to the kubelet and pass this information to the containerd or any other container runtime. When the containerd starts to create the container in the backend, it will send back the response to the API server and this will be stored in the etcd. Finally the API server will pass the acknowledgement to the kubelet, Therefore we were able to see the console output as a particular pod was created and its details.
