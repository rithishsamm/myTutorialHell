# 4.Â CronJob Job history limits
CronJob Job history limits - [Doc]
```sh
kubectl create -f c/cjName.yaml
```
limiting the history/numbers/executions  of the `CronJobs`, whether it is successful or fail, 

The default values of `successfulJobsHistoryLimit`
If successful, `successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 3`
If fails, `Failed Job Histry Limit: 1`

To verify,
```sh
kubectl describe cj cjName
```

To modify these values where there should be no limits,
>there are not supposed to be stored in the `jobHistory`. The catch/condition is since these doesn't get stored in the history, we couldn't be able to pull up the records from the history to troubleshoot if required.

In order to do that, we should change and pass the `param` to
`successfulJobsHistoryLimit=0` BUT DON'T DO IT, INSTEAD JUST INCREASE THE LIMIT, 5MAX for success, 3MAX for fail. Do proceed with the default value itself.

To edit the values,
```sh
kubectl edit cj cjName
```
and simply change the params.
