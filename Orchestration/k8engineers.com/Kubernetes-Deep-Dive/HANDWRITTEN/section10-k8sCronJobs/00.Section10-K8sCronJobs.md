Section 10: K8s Cron Jobs
# 1. Introduction to CronJobs (cj)
K8s workload resource Introduction to Cronjobs (cj) - [Doc]

Following to Job which just executes Job after our command. How bout executing Jobs  as per schedule, based on specific times and such. Same Linux's `crontab` stuff. we have **CronJobs** to run the batch/shell script/job operation.

WILL DIVE DEEPER INTO THE ==**CronJobs `cj`**== FOR OUR OPERATIONS.

> K8s Workload Resource:  ==**CronJobs `cj`**==

##### K8s Workload Resources: **Jobs** `jobs`
- CronJob is a workload resource which will ensure one or more Pods create and terminate successfully
- In general, we use `CronJobs` to run some batch operations like backups, restore, report generation etc., for scheduled time period (like `crontab`)
- Workflow: CronJob -> Job -> POD
- `apiVersion` for `cronjob` object is `batch/v1`
- all `CronJob` schedules are based on timezone of the `kube-controller-manager`
- CronJob uses `jobTemplate` to create `Jobs` followed by `podTemplate`
- Cron schedules syntax:
><minute><hour><dayOfTheMonth><month><dayOfTheWeek>
 1. <minute>: 0 - 59
 2. <hour>: 0 - 23
 3. <day of the month>: 1 - 31
 4. <month>: 1 - 12
 5. <day of the week>: 0 - 6 (sun - sat or starting 3 letter of each)
