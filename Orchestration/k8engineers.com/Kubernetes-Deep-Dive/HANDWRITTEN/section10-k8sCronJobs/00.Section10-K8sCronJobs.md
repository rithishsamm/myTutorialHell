Section 10: K8s Cron Jobs
# 1. Introduction to CronJobs (cj)
K8s workload resource Introduction to Cronjobs (cj) - [Doc]

Following to Job which just executes Job after our command. How bout executing Jobs  as per schedule, based on specific times and such. Same Linux's `crontab` stuff. we have **CronJobs** to run the batch/shell script/job operation.

to understand the same in brief, must recall `Jobs`. 

WILL DIVE DEEPER INTO THE ==**CronJobs `cj`**== FOR OUR OPERATIONS.

> K8s Workload Resource:  ==**CronJobs `cj`**==

##### K8s Workload Resources: **Jobs** `jobs`
- CronJob is a workload resource which will ensure one or more Pods create and terminate successfully
- In general, we use `CronJobs` to run some batch operations like backups, restore, report generation etc., for scheduled time period (like `crontab`)
- Workflow: CronJob -> Job -> POD
- `apiVersion` for `cronjob` object is `batch/v1`
- all `CronJob` schedules are based on timezone of the `kube-controller-manager`
- CronJob uses `jobTemplate` to create `Jobs` followed by `podTemplate`
- we can set `.spec.timezone` to valid time zone to control the schedule of `CronTab`, if `CronJobTimeZone` feature gate enabled (v1.25 beta) -   (to make it work appropriately according to the timing.)
- We can suspend the `cronjob` as well and start again by `.spec.suspend` value to true or false. The command is
```
kubectl patch cronjob/<cronJob-name> --type=strategic --patch '{"spec":{"suspend": true}}'
```
- Cron schedules syntax:
```cron
<mins><hrs><dayOfTheMonth><month><dayOfTheWeek>
```
```
1) <minute>: 0 - 59
2) <hour>: 0 - 23
3) <day of the month>: 1 - 31
4) <month>: 1 - 12
5) <day of the week>: 0 - 6 (sun - sat or starting 3 letter of each)
```


##### 1. `CronJob` is a workload resource which will ensure one or more `Pods` create and terminate successfully
`Job` running a specific operation for that time. `Cron` is nothing but same to run operation scheduled time periodically to run the same on a basis.  


##### 2. In general, we use `CronJobs` to run some `batch` operations like *backups*, *restore*, *report generation* etc., for scheduled time period (like `crontab`)
We use `CronJobs` to run some `batch` operations like *backups*, *restore*, *report generation* etc., for scheduled time period (like `crontab`)


##### 3. Workflow: `CronJob` -> `Job` -> `POD`
since it is as same job but periodic. 
CronJob -> creates `Job` object -> creates `Pod` to run the execution


##### 4. `apiVersion` for `cronjob` object is `batch/v1`
```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
```


##### 5. all `CronJob` schedules are based on time zone of the `kube-controller-manager`
Time zone used by `kube-controller-manager` = Time zone of `Cron`.

##### 6. CronJob uses `jobTemplate` to create `Jobs` followed by `podTemplate`
**`Cron`** ->` jobTemplate` -> **`Job`** ->  `PodTemplate` -> **`Pod`**


##### 7. we can set `.spec.timezone` to valid time zone to control the schedule of `CronTab`, if `CronJobTimeZone` feature gate enabled (v1.25 beta) -   (to make it work appropriately according to the timing.)
as we previously mentioned that, Time zone used by `kube-controller-manager` = Time zone of `Cron`.

Since the `Cron` is heavily depends on the Time and periods, timezone. 



##### 8. We can suspend the `cronjob` as well and start again by `.spec.suspend` value to true or false. The command is
 ```
kubectl patch cronjob/<cronJob-name> --type=strategic --patch '{"spec":{"suspend": true}}'
```




##### 10. Cron schedules syntax:
**The syntax of `CronJob`: (More of `crontab`)**
```cron
<mins><hrs><dateOfTheMonth><month><dayOfTheWeek>
```
```
11) <minute>: 0 - 59
12) <hour>: 0 - 23 (no12hrFormat)
13) <date of the month>: 1 - 31
14) <month>: 1 - 12
15) <day of the week>: 0 - 6 (sun - sat or starting 3 letter of each)
```

| mins | hrs  | dateOfTheMonth | month | dayOfTheWeek |
| ---- | ---- | -------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| 0-59 | 0-23 | 1-31           | 1-12  | 0-6/day      |
