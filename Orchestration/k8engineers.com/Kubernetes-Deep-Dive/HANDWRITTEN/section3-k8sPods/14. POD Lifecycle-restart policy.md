###### Pod Lifecycle Restart Policy - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F9.Pod%20Lifecycle%20Restart%20Policy.docx)

same spec but more about `restart-policy` just like in `docker-compose`.
>THE `pod-restart` policy will be defined on pod level, not on container level.

**What are all the supported policies that we have?**
1) never
2) always - default
3) On Failure

| Restart Policy    | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --restart=Never   | Containers will not be restarted by kubelet due to any exit code >=0. Kubelet won't restart if app fails to work.                                                |
| --restart=Always  | Kubelet will try to restart containers exited with >=0 (failed or stopped due to any reason). To avoid downtime due to any failure caused.                       |
| --restart=Failure | Containers gets started by kubelet only if it gets failed with exit code > 0. Only if any failure. Applies where we need to find the root cause of the failure.  |
**We have few things to be consider when we work with `restart-policy`**:
1) Backoff Delay - restarts containers for every **10s, 20s, 30s..5mins,** if it throws exit code either 0 or 1.  
2) After restarting under backoff delay, it'll watch the container where the event has occurred for **10mins** whether it fails back or not. after 10mins without any fail, backoff delay gets turned off and backs up to 0 and do the same. 
>THIS IS HOW `kubelet` HANDLES THE `restart-policy` FOR OUR CONTAINERS.

> [!NOTE] Note
> 1) Kubelet restarts container with exponential back-off delay of 10s, 20s, 30s
> 2) Kubelet resets the backoff timer for the container, if no problem found for 10mins
###### Will see how to write/apply one: 
##### `always`
(if nothing declared, default policy will get applied with is :`always`) here's the manifest of launching a multi-container pod.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hexrapp
  labels:
    app: hexrapp
    type: web
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hexrapp-writer
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
      mountPath: /var/tmp
  - name: hexrapp-server
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      name: http
      hostPort: 8090
      hostIP: 192.168.0.222
      protocol: TCP
    volumeMounts:
    - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:                  
  - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```
In this multi-container pod, one being a writer saving the data and one serves it the web. since, we haven't applied any `restart-policy` to these. So, **always** as default. 

To check that, simply apply the same and see,
```
kubectl create -f podManifestFile.yaml
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl describe po <podname>
```
scroll down and you'll find no `restart policy` under that. lol. also in the pod level too. nothing, You will find that printing that YAML of the same.
```
kubectl get po -o yaml 
kubectl get po podname -o yaml | grep restart
```
in the container section, under the spec of it, will find that. 
	restartPolicy: Always

HENCE PROVED THAT IF NO restart-policy is declared, it goes with the default which is `Always`. 
-> WHAT DOES IT MEAN?  Failure by any means exit by 0, exit 0, whatever 0, it will always restarts the container. 

###### check this by causing a failure to this pod:
to do that, will make a slight change in the `yaml` file
```
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hexrapp-writer
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10;exit 0; done"]
```
```
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10;exit 1; done"]
```
which prints the date and terminates the container. 
WITH THIS LOGIC APPLIED, THE CONTAINER MUST RESTART DUE TO IT'S `restart-policy` 
```
kubectl create -f podmanifestfile.yaml
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl get po -o wide -w
kubectl describe po <podname> 
```
Throws: running and notReady one on one and can see by describing exit code, restart count and policy  proved!
> => IT JUST KEEPS ON STARTING THE CONTAINER ALWAYS.

##### `on-failure;`
JUST ADDING ONE MORE PARAMETER which is `restart-policy` :

> [!NOTE] Title
> these `restart-policy` should be declared only under the spec section NOT THE CONTAINERS. Can be declared above or below container section under spec.

```
spec:
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
  containers:
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
  ...
```
restarts if container on failure by any means. 

##### `never;`
JUST MODDING THAT ONE PARAMETER which is `restart-policy` :

> [!NOTE] Title
> these `restart-policy` should be declared only under the spec section NOT THE CONTAINERS. Can be declared above or below container section under spec.

```
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
  ...
```
never restarts if anything occurs.
