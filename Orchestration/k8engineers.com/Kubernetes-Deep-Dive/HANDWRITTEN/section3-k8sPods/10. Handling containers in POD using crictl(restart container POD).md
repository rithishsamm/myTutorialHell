###### Handling containers in Pod using crictl - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F6.Handling%20containers%20in%20Pod%20using%20crictl_.docx)
Will re-spin a container. Instead of deleting, will recreating the same. So that we can't loose any data since they are coupled with each other.
```
kubectl describe po -o wide
kubectl describe po podname
```
in containers section, restart-counts shows zero for both the containers FYI.  will see count after restart. it will be counted. 

HOW TO RESTART A CONTAINER: (told you that container related actions can be performed by `crictl` since it is managed by `containerd` which is a cri itself.
```
crictl ps #shows running container details
crictl stop <containerid>
crictl rm <containerid>
crictl ps
```
 If i perform removing or deleting a container, which it wont get deleted. IT'S DESIRED STATE.
```
kubectl describe po podname 
```
check container and shows the restart has been occurred. But not supposed to losse data still. CHECK!
```
kubectl get po -o wide
curl podIP
```
viola! data is not lost. 
>**BENEFIT OF THE SHARED VOLUME**: is even if i recreate the same containers, the volumes will be persistent and resilient remaining the same!.

**CHECK SHARED VOLUME:**
```
kubectl get po -o yaml | grep uid
sudo ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/<podUID>/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/<sharedVolInYAML>/index.html 
```

 If the Pod gets deleted, no mounts will get popped up yet. if gets recreated, it will pops back up too under the pod. if
```
kubectl delete po <podName>
sudo ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/<podUID>/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/<sharedVolInYAML>/index.html 

#will throw: No such file or directory
```
nothing will pop-up. which will not be present in the other side too.
