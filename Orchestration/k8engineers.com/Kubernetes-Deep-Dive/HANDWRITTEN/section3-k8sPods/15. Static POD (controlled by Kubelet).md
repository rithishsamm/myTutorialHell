15. Static POD (controlled by Kubelet)
###### Static Pod (Controlled by kubelet) - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F10.Static%20Pod%20(Controlled%20by%20kubelet).docx)

Understanding Static Pod for deploying applications on K8s:
>STATIC PODS -> Node centric Pods, the **kube-components** that we use such as etcd, kube-controller, scheduler, and apiserver POD are handled by the node itself, not by `kubectl` are handled by that are in such of these containers.

- Static Pod (is node specific) will be managed by **kubelet daemon** on the appropriate node.
-- so far we've been working pods by communicating the same by passing manifests files via `kubectl` or passing API Calls. Who are accessing and receiving the same? `kube-apiserver`, that validates and scheme checks and passes it to store in `etcd` and to `scheduler` and to compute node's `kubelet` to `cri` to `containers`
- Static Pod will **not be controlled** by kube-apiserver (kube API Calls), by kubelet daemon which runs on specific node.
- Deleting Static Pod through API or Kubectl will not effect the application, where kubelet will recreate it. Even from controlling that POD via `kubectl`, nothing works.
- Static POD names will be added with suffix of node name. 
-- static pod = (podName + nodeName) can understand that it is a static pod. 
	- These Static POD manifest can be defined through **Filesystem-hosted** or **Web-Hosted**, will see such implementations further.
- Kubelet can read default directory `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`, If we place manifest file (either JSON or YAML) to create static POD for **Filesystem-hosted** approach. All the static pod manifest lies here, so whatever file that we put here, the `kubectl` will consider the same as static pods. since it is the default directory for such kube components. => THIS APPROACH OF CREATING STATIC PODS is **Filesystem-hosted** approach.
- Kubelet can download manifest file from the by passing `--manifest-url=<URL>` argument for **Web-hosted** approach. Somewhere in the web, there is a static pod manifest file. If i
```
kubectl create -f --manifest-url=<URL> 
```
downloading that using this and create pod, is an other approach of creating **Static Pod** using Web Based Approach.
