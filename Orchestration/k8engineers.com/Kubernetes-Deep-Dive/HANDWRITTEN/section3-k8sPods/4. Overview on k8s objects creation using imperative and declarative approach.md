###### Overview on k8s objects creation using imperative and declarative approach

Declarative Approach - yaml manifest
Imperative - All by commands

**APPROCHES TO CREATE OBJECTS ON K8s**: there are two approaches,
`kubectl` : 
e.g.: executing `kubectl`, need to create some objects on our Kubernetes Cluster. Not just pod by deployment, services, state sets and more. HOW TO CREATE SUCH OBJECTS?
- **Declarative approach** -  Declaring the same by giving all the required objects by writing it in a `YAML` File.
This YAML will be given via `kubectl`to the `api-server` that takes cares of the rest by receiving it, doing schema validation and passed information to the `etcd` that talks to  its relevant components in order to create all the same which we've declared in the manifests.
- **Imperative approach -**  Creating resources from the CLI itself. giving it all in our CLI as commands to create objects. No YAML or JSON files excepts systems, services and components needs and manifests. 
eg: If using 
- docker with cli - imperative approach
- writing docker-compose file in YAML - Declarative approach.
Here in `kubectl`, can use both of these approaches. 

###### Understanding Declarative Approach: (!IMP - using irl)

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-demo
 labels:
  app: nginx
  env: prod
spec:
 containers:
   -name: nginx
    image: nginx:lts #latesttag
   ports:
   - name: nginx-port
     containerPort: 80
     protocol: TCP
   env:
    -name: USERNAME
     value: "admin"
   resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "0.2"
      memory: "500Mi" #Ki,Mi,Gi,Ti
     requests:
      cpu: "0.2"
      memory: "200Mi"
    volumeMounts:
     -name: nginx-data
      mountPath: /var/www/html
volumes:
 - name: nginx-data
   emptyDir: {}
```
1. `apiVersion`: ==version of the object. max v3==, *version of what are all the objects that are going to get created.* (will see more on the same by how to confirm and verify the same)
2. `kind`: Object/ Resource name -> ==Kind of object== ,*what object that i want to create*.
3. `metadata`:  ==metadata to the object for labeling each, useful for filtering== *name that i want to assign to my POD*, *adding additional information by labeling the object for further identification and filtration by specifying relevant key word.* volumes, containers, init-containers and more. Specifying how many containers i want to create, all the relevant parameters to that containers, - naming it, image, assigning port, passing env variables, resources specs, volume mounting
- name: nginx-demo
- labels: (***app***: nginx, ***env***: prod)
5. `specs`: ==container specifications to be handles by the POD== *specifying what are all the things that i want to create*, 
- containers:
-  -- name: nginx
-  - image: nginx:lts ==tag==
-  - ports (***-name***: nginx-port, ***containerPort***: 80, ***protocol***: TCP) ==container ports section== 
- - env (***-name***: db_username , ***value***: "admin") ==container environment variables== 
- - resources: (***limits***: ***cpu***: "1" ***memory***: "500Mi", ***requests***: ***cpu***: "0.5" ***memory***: "200Mi" ) ==container resource allocation== 
- - volumeMounts: (***-name***: nginx-data, ***mountPath***: /var/www/html) ==container volume mounting point== 
- `volumes`: ==shared volume for POD Containers== 
- --name: nginx-data
- emptyDir:  {}
ALL `compose.yaml` CONTENT.

###### Understanding Imperative Approach: (opt)
Imperative approach is all the same by giving commands. creating each by imperative will be much of a pain So, Why Imperative even exist. 
Helps in,
- smaller operations
- frequent object creation
- patchwork
- operation intensive works
- depends on the circumstances and condition, usage may vary.
BUT IN MOST OF OUR TIME, **==DECLARATIVE APPROACH IS STAGNENT==**. REST OF THE CONDITIONS, imperative.
