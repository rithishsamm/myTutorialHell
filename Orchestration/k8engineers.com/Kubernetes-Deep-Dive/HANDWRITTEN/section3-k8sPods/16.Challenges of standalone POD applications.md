####  16.Challenges of standalone POD applications
###### Challenges of Pods - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F11.Challenges%20of%20Standalone%20Pod.docx)
 Will see about PODS challenges.
The Challenges:
- POD is a basic entity to run application on K8s Cluster. 
> Knowledge about PODs are mandatory in-order to work with or deploy applications or other vectors of concepts such as services, deploymentSet, ReplicaSet, Statefulset, DaemonSet, jobs, Cron, controllers on K8s which ultimate contribute to such POD CREATION process and such where POD is the entity that will be running all these services and the application, so knowing in brief about **PODs** is a basic requirement to get started with.
- POD works as a standalone application in K8s Cluster. Work standalone which it doesn't rely on anything else but `kubelet` in order work in ease.
- PODs are not bind/bounded to specific node (unless we use **nodeName**, **nodeSelector**, **nodeAffinity** etc..,) 
> e.g.: ill be trying to launch a pod, request will be sent to scheduler deciding which node it should deploy the pod in.  If i delete and relaunch the same pod, can't guarantee that i get the same IP and to same node to get deployed into. Unless you register that manifest with parameters like  **nodeName**, **nodeSelector**, **nodeAffinity** etc.  
- POD Lifecycle is not managed by K8s Controller. 
> -- If pod gets deleted by any failure, went wrong while creating, throws error or gets failed and such, K8s wont recreate it. You should be recreate that (with some programmatic and restart policy exceptions). 
- For application to be deployed with HA, POD object is not a right solution
> -- e.g.: For HA Setup, POD object/Standalone isn't the right solution. Instead we should go for ReplicaSet, Replication Controller, Deployment, DaemonSet and such. 
- In real-time environments of K8s Cluster, we don't deploy application as standalone POD
> - no one is going to deploy applications as a standalone pod. Any K8s real time environment, no one is going to use simply standalone PODs in Production. will be using ReplicaSet, Replication Controller, Deployment, DaemonSet and such. due to specific but resilient reasons.
- We should always define containers in POD are application specific. one for one seperately, not to the whole in one.
- Failed PODs should be deleted by us through kubectl or API (**terminated-pod-gc-threshold**)
> -- e.g. if a failure occurs, it will be shown and it will exist in get command unless we remove it. doesn't get removed automatically. unless `terminated-pod-gc-threshold` which is a garbage collection condition is applied. threshold = grace period. 
- If a **Node** dies, the PODs scheduled to that node are **`scheduled for deletion`** after a timeout period. merely 30secs.

These are all the challenges met in standalone PODs.
