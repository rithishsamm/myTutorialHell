#### 11. Access POD application outside cluster (hostPort)
###### Access pod application outside cluster (hostPort) - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F7.Access%20pod%20application%20outside%20cluster(hostport).docx)
**Use case:** ==production like environment making the application publicly availed to the users delivering and assessing application outside the kubernetes clusters where all our applications deployed as a pod.== 

**If i want to access application outside the kubernetes clusters if my applications are deployed as a pod. HOW TO MAKE THIS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC USERS.**?
In this below given diagram,
- **User Outside Cluster - OutUser (end user):** A user outside would like to assess our nginx application for example. 
- **User Inside Cluster - InUser (ops):** On the other hand, we have a user inside the cluster.

This **InUser** trying to access the `nginx` app. 
Since the **InUser** is inside the cluster, he can be able to open the app 

via both the **Control Plane** and **Worker Node**. -> Using POD's `IP:Port` number to use the application. -> Generally, the `nginx` runs on port:80

*Here, the user inside the cluster can be able to login to the application simply by accessing the PODs IP and the port number. WHICH IS FINE. BUT* 

For the:
**OutUser**??:
==**HOW TO DO THE SAME MAKING THAT APPLICATION AVAILABLE TO THE OutUser WHO IS SITTING OUTSIDE AND HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE CLUSTER.** 
**A normal client user who is not a part of the K8s cluster?**==

==Ans: **Port Forwarding** (just like in docker)== a.k.a **Port Binding** AND ALL OF THESE CAN BE HANDLED AND WILL BE DONE WITHIN THE `PORT` SECTION.

> [!NOTE] Port Binding - making the application accessible for the **OutUser**
> Making this possible by ==binding== the host machine's port the control plane node. Will take Hosts's `IP:port` 8090 -> bind -> Container Port Number
> 
> Can make this possible by binding, **Host**'s port number <=> **Control plane node**'s Port Number. 
> **enp0s3Host**:8090 < - = - >  **PodIP**:nginx'sPort80



>Theory: 
**OutUser:**  On the Node where the POD is running. 
The Host IP / K8s Cluster Host Node's `IP:Port` -> the request will be redirected to due to **Port Binding** -> to Container's Port Number.
>==THIS WHY WE CAN EXPOSE THE APPLICATION (which is inside a cluster) TO THE INTERNET(out from K8s).==

*Will see how to implement the same IRL by deploying multi-container pod and binding it with the host in practice. HOW TO ACCESS APPLICATION OUTSIDE THE K8s CLUSTER*

These are some of the fields with the description we can implement in the container ports section. writing port section on a yaml file, these fields/parameters are mandatory and to be grasped.

BEFORE WRITING YAML FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION, 
For **Port** Section, we can write all these below given parameters, 
`containerPort`: int datatype: **Applications Port that is listening on that container**
`hostIP`: int datatype: **The host machine's IP Address.** 
`hostPort`: int datatype: **The host machine's Port** Bind port: this side (left) of the port -> **8080**:80 <- node port that which the application is running. 
THESE HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF **`kube-proxy`.** 
`name`: string datatype: entries **name** that can be defined in the port section
`protocol`: int datatype:  Can define **TCP/UDP** here.
WILL SEE ALL THAT BY WRITING ONE.

| Field                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Container Port** (integer) | Container's Port -  number to expose on the pods ip address. be a valid port number, 0 < x< 65536                                                                                                                                                          |
| **hostIP** (string)          | HostIP to be exposed `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`What host IP to bind the external port to. specific node IP address                                                                                                                                |
| **hostPort** (integer)       | Port number to expose on the host. This must be a valid port number, 0 < x< 65536, verify which port the service is running on - specific Port of the POD that the service is running -> redirected to ContainerPort. This action is done by `kube-proxy`. |
| **Name** (string)            | This must be an IANA_SVC_NAME and unique within the pod. Name of the port can be referred to by the services.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Protocol** (string)        | Protocols for the port must be UDP, TCP or SCTP. The Default is TCP.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
All the parameters that you can write in the `spec` section of the Containers, Under the Containers Block in the POD manifest file. 

For practice, we will be putting all these on TOP of our last **multi-container PODs manifests**. 
HOW TO EXPOSE THE APPLICATION OUTSIDE THE K8s CLUSTER?:
Here, The app has to running the `nginx` as the multicontainer-pod out of K8s Cluster. To do that, have to modify all the `port`'s entries telling that these are the port that we going to run our service on.
not just `containerPort` is going to help exposing outside the K8s Cluster but inside it does. 

Lets add more param to this `port` section to make it expose to the same. x`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hexrapp
  labels:
    app: hexrapp
    type: web
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hexrapp-writer
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
      mountPath: /var/tmp
  - name: hexrapp-server
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:                  
  - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

```yaml
#EDIT/MODIFICATION OCCURS UNDER THE `nginx` CONTAINER, `Port` Section
- name: hexrapp-server
  image: nginx
  ports:
  - containerPort: 80
    name: http #name of this bind
    hostPort: 8090 #where it is getting launched,exposing HostPort to bind it to the Cont.
    protocol: TCP 
#this can be left blank too. Proceeds with the default which is TCP itself.
      hostIP: vmorHostIP
#or you can leave this blank since it is default already.
```

All done. Now apply! 
Before proceeding. Do check in prior if there is any port has been already binding with this. 
Delete the pod we created before if it exists.
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl delete -f po <podyamlFile.yaml>
kubectl create -f <newpodorsameyamlfile.yaml>
#to save resources or leave it as it is. 
```
Cross verify the status
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
```

Here,
- **InUser**: If user has to use the app from inside K8s using any of the node and `curl` the IP (inside the cluster)
- **OutUser**: If, to check the same for the user outside the cluster, 
`ip` of the workerNode's host machine. 
```
hostIP/8090

#for me, it was like
http://192.168.0.222:8090/
```

With this we can able to access the ap outside the K8s Cluster using the `hostPort` and `hostIP`.

Challenges in this `hostPort` is:
**Challenge1:** 
If you want to do the same but for a different application similarly or with the same functionality, CANT DO THAT. 
Redeploy or spin up a new application with the **same port number on the same node**, NOT POSSIBLE.

**Challenge2:** 
Now it is all up and running. all good. If i happened to recreate the pod,  Can't guarantee that these will work just fine on the same node. Might run in any of the control plane or compute plane node.
How do i change the IP address in the frontend or to the clients/users outside the cluster.

FOR SPOT PURPOSES, WE CAN DO THIS, BUT ON PROD ON A LONGER RUN. **NOT THE BEST PRACTICE.**

>NOT A FEASIBLE WAY OR SOLUTION TO LAUNCH OR EXPOSE THE APPLICATION IN OR OUT ON A K8s CLUSTER. **THIS WAY**

IRL, WE WONT BE LAUNCHING THESE PODS LIKE THIS BLUNTLY WITHOUT DEFINING ALL THE SPECIFICS THAT WHERE IT HAS TO BE RAN.

> NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION IN REALTIME. WILL SEE THE BEST PRACTICES IN BRIEF.
