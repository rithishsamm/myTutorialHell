#### 11. Access POD application outside cluster(hostPort)
###### Access pod application outside cluster(hostPort) - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F7.Access%20pod%20application%20outside%20cluster(hostport).docx)

**Use case:** ==production like environment making the application publicly availed to the users delivering and assessing application outside the kubernetes clusters where all our applications deployed as a pod.== If i want to access application outside the kubernetes clusters if my applications are deployed as a pod inside a container. HOW TO MAKE THIS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC USERS. 

In this below given diagram,
- A user outside would like to assess our nginx application for example.
- On the other hand, we have a user inside the node (control plane) assessing our application from inside via the **pod IP** address and **the port number.** -> nginx:80 either into the **control plane node** or the worker **node**. 
*Here, the user inside the cluster can be able to login to the application simply by accessing the PODs IP and via the port number. WHICH IS FINE. BUT*  

**HOW TO DO THE SAME MAKING THAT APPLICATION AVAILABLE TO USER WHO IS SITTING OUTSIDE THE CLUSTER.** **A normal client user how is not a part inside the K8s cluster?**
==Ans: Port Forwarding (just like in docker)== AND ALL OF THESE CAN BE HANDLED AND WILL BE DONE WITHIN THE `PORT` SECTION.

Making this possible by binding the host machine's port the control plane node. Will take port:8090 for example. 

Can make this possible by binding, **Host**'s port number <=> **Control plane node**'s Port Number. 
> **enp0s3Host**:8090 < - = - >  **PodIP**:nginx'sPort80

Will see how to implement the same IRL by deploying multi-container pod and binding it with the host in practice.

These are some of the fields with the description we can implement in the container ports section. writing port section on a yaml file, these fields/parameters are mandatory and to be grasped.

BEFORE WRITING YAML FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION, For **Port** Section, we can write all these below given parameters, 
`containerPort`: int datatype: **Applications Port that is listening on that container**
`hostIP`: int datatype: **The host machine's IP Address.** 
`hostPort`: int datatype: **The host machine's Port** Bind port: this side (left) of the port -> **8080**:80 <- node port that which the application is running. 
THESE HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF **`kube-proxy`.** 
`name`: string datatype: entries **name** that can be defined in the port section
`protocol`: int datatype:  Can define **TCP/UDP** here.
WILL SEE ALL THAT BY WRITING ONE.

| Field                    | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Container Port (integer) | Port number to expose on the pods ip address<br>This must be a valid port number, 0 < x< 65536                |
| hostIP (string)          | What host IP to bind the external port to.                                                                    |
| hostPort (integer)       | Port number to expose on the host. This must be a valid port number, 0 < x< 65536                             |
| Name (string)            | This must be an IANA_SVC_NAME and unique within the pod. Name of the port can be referred to by the services. |
| Protocol (string)        | Protocols for the port must be UDP, TCP or SCTP. The Default is TCP.                                          |
For practice, we will be putting all these on TOP of our last **multi-container PODs manifests**. 
HOW TO EXPOSE THE APPLICATION OUTSIDE THE K8s CLUSTER: Here,
The app has been running as `nginx` out of K8s Cluster. 
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hexrapp
  labels:
    app: hexrapp
    type: web
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hexrapp-writer
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
      mountPath: /var/tmp
  - name: hexrapp-server
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:                  
  - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

```
#EDIT/MODIFICATION OCCURS UNDER THE `nginx` CONTAINER, `Port` Section
- name: hexrapp-server
  image: nginx
  ports:
  - containerPort: 80
    name: http
    hostPort: 8090
    protocol: TCP 
#this can be left blank too. Proceeds with the default which is TCP itself.
      hostIP: vmorHostIP
#or you can leave this blank since it is default already.
```

All done. Now apply! 
Before proceeding. Do check in prior if there is any port has been already binding with this. Delete the pod we created before if it exists.
```
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl delete -f po <podyamlFile.yaml>
kubectl create -f <newpodorsameyamlfile.yaml>
```
Cross verify the status
```
kubectl get po -o wide
```

Here,
- If user has to use the app from inside any of the node and `curl` the IP
- If the for a user outside the cluster, 
```
hostIP/8090

#for me, it was liek
http://192.168.0.222:8090/
```

Challenges in these:
**Challenge1:** 
If you want to do the same but for a different application similarly or with the same functionality, CANT DO THAT. 
Redeploy or spin up a new application with the same port number on the same node, NO POSSIBLE.
**Challenge2:** 
Now it is all up and running. all good. If i happened to recreate the pod,  Can't guarantee that these will work just fine on the same node. Might run in any of the control plane or compute plane node.
How do i change the IP address in the frontend or to the clients/users outside the cluster.

>NOT A FEASIBLE WAY OR SOLUTION TO LAUNCH OR EXPOSE THE APPLICATION IN OR OUT ON A K8s CLUSTER. 

IRL, WE WONT BE LAUNCHING THESE PODS LIKE THIS BLUNTLY WITHOUT DEFINING ALL THE SPECIFICS THAT WHERE IT HAS TO BE RAN.

> NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION IN REALTIME. WILL SEE THE BEST PRACTICES IN BRIEF.
