TILL NOW WE HAVE SEEN CREATING PODS in both declarative and imperative method. **WILL SEE THE WORKFLOW OF A POD CREATION:** (some basic things to know how things works under the hood while we create pods).
**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE PASS COMMAND?** 
```
kubectl create/apply -f file.yaml`
```
>**AND HOW CRI CREATES CONTAINERS AND STUFF? AND
>HOW WE GET THE RESPONSE OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT?**

REFERRING TO THE DIAGRAM:  (WE HAVE ALL THE RELEVANT COMPONENTS THAT EXIST INBETWEEN IN TERMS OF CREATING A POD)
`kubectl`  < - >  `kube-apiserver`  < - >  `etcd`  < - >  `scheduler`  < - > `kubelet`  < - > `containerd`

**DECODING THE FLOWCHART:**
INPUT TO CREATE POD:
1) USER -> `kubectl`  --> `kube-apiserver`
-- **user** passes --> **pod creation request** will be sent via `kubectl` --> to `kube-apiserver`
2) Now, `kube-apiserver` --> will verify with `etcd` 
`etcd`will respond back to `apiserver` . 
-- (**to check and return data whether the resource already exist or not**)
if already exists, spins up the POD!
if the resource doesn't exist, 
3) `etcd` will store the config --> and respond back to `apiserver`
4) `apiserver` --> will pass it to the `scheduler`
-- `scheduler` will analyze based on some metrics and algorithm to picks the suitable node to deploy the POD.
After deciding it, `scheduler` --> to `apiserver`, where that information gets stored in `etcd`
>`etcd` can't talk to `scheduler` , likewise `scheduler` can't talk to `etcd` too. the reason why the `scheduler`  --> passed info to `apiserver`  -x- not the `etcd`
4) after storing the information from `apiserver` to `etcd` and acknowledges back, `apiserver` --> will talk back to `scheduler` as passes the acknowledgement to create `pods` to  any one of the relevant node, says back to `apiserver` back. ``
> all these decision has been done here, ON THE CONTROL PLANE NODE.
5) After getting all that info from `Control Plane`'s `api-server` --> `kubelet` service, 
`kubelet` --> will pass command via `crictl` to `containerd or any cri` creating all the relevant `PODs`
6) after all `PODs` has been created, `containerd or any cri` --> will send back the **acknowledgement** to `kubelet`
7) again, `kubelet` --> will pass that acknowledgement info to `apiserver`
8) `apiserver` --> stores that info too in `etcd`
9) `etcd` --> sends back the acknowledgement to `apisever` 
10) `apiserver` --> will send info to `kubelet` and 
11) `apiserver` --> WILL SEND and we will be RECEIVING THE CONSOLE OUTPUT THAT THE **PODS HAS BEEN CREATED, FAILED OR PENDING**
12) ALL DONE!
Now we can take care working with the rest as 
```
kubectl get pod -o wide -A
kubectl describe pod
```
