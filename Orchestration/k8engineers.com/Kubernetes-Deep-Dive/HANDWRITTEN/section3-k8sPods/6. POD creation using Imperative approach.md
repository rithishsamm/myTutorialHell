#### 6.POD creation using Imperative approach
###### Pods creation using imperative approach - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F3.Pods%20creation%20using%20imperative%20approach.docx)
Will cover creating a pod using imperative approach simply by passing commands via the cli.

We will explore ways to quickly access command references, k8s-object-specific commands, helpful aliases, and command completion. But first, how are command strings built?

before that,
will delete the pod and respawn for our practice sake.
```
kubectl delete po <podname> 
/ --all(not recommended espeacially in prod env)
```

> [!NOTE] small note about `namespaces`
> if you do,
> ```
> kubectl get po -o wide
> ```
> it will tell you that,
> *No resources found in default namespace.*
> What is namespace means here? 
> **Namespace** - an isolated environment. if you create any object or resource, it will housed under default namespace.

WILL SEE MORE ON THAT IN FUTURE.

| obj                        | Docker declarative     | Docker imperative | K8s declarative | K8s imperative         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Creating  an image/pod** | Dockerfile             | `docker build`    | manifests       | `kubectl create/apply` |
| **Running an image/pod**   | Docker desktop or extn | `docker run`      | manifests       | `kubectl run`          |
| **Executing a pod**        | terminal, vscode, etc  | `docker exec`     | manifests       | `kubectl exec`         |
similar to that! 

Now back to topic,
###### Creating POD using imperative approach
```
kubectl run --help
```
refer the same in brief and will see that here one by one. says how to use the same via `cli`

###### Command Line Syntax:
The syntax:
-> English and Chinese are¬†`subject-verb-object (SVO)`¬†languages.
-> Hindi and Korean are¬†`subject-object-verb (SOV)`¬†languages.

**If kubectl were a language, it would be a¬†`kubectl + verb + object/[name optional] + flag`¬†(kvof) language üòÑ**

![[Pasted image 20241203184416.png]]
Also similar to languages, the best way to learn and absorb grammar is by using it in context and not memorizing long verb and object lists.

**gentle reminder:**
> _‚ÑπÔ∏è If you are stuck and want to quickly reference the existing Kubernetes objects in any Kubernetes version run_¬†`_kubectl api-resources_`_._

*Commands are built by choosing that¬†`action [verb]`¬†you want to apply to the desired Kubernetes¬†`resource [object]`¬†usually followed by the name of the resource additionally you have a large array of¬†`filters [flags]`¬†that can be applied to the command which will determine the final scope and output.*
*![[Pasted image 20241203184512.png]]*

*Let‚Äôs look at a simple example of command building using the commonly used¬†`get`¬†verb to retrieve all resources in the¬†namespace named as your`app`, and the output is in¬†`yaml`¬†format:*
```
kubectl get all --namespace app -o yaml
```

*gentle reminder:*
>*‚ÑπÔ∏è If you come across a Kubernetes resource that you haven‚Äôt heard of before or need a refresher use_¬†`_kubectl explain [resource-name]_`¬†to get an in-terminal description and usage instructions.*

***USAGE/SYNTAX:***
```
  kubectl run NAME --image=image [--env="key=value"] [--port=port] [--dry-run=server|client] [--overrides=inline-json]
[--command] -- [COMMAND] [args...] [options]
```
*also, you can refer,* 
```
kubectl options
```
*for list of global command-line options that you can make use out of. ALL THE OPTIONS/PARAMETERS THAT WE CAN PASS.*

###### Working imperatively
When working in Kubernetes environments your tasks are many, anything from deploying new apps, troubleshooting faulty resources, inspecting usage, and much more. Later on, we will explore how useful declarative ways of working are more appropriate for defining and deploying workloads, but for everything else we have our arsenal of useful imperative Kubernetes commands at the ready.

Simple commands to get us started are:

**WILL SEE CREATING A RESOURCE BY RUNNING THE SAME (CMDs) - IMPERATIVE APPROACH**
JUST LIKE WE DO IN DOCKER.
```
kubectl run -it <podname> --image=<imgname:v> --restart=Always/onfailure/never  
```

```
kubectl run -it hexrapp --image=nginx:latest --restart=Always
```

**TO CHECK LOGS OF A POD:**
```
kubectl logs <podname>
```
not the IP Address.

**OF MULTIPLE PODS:**
```
kubectl logs podname1 podname2 .. podnamen
```
HERE,NOW YOU CAN ABLE TO CREATE OBJECTS/RESOURCES USING IMPERATIVE APPROACH. (From the cli)

BUT,
> **DECLARATIVE APPROACH IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

WHY?
- Operational Intensive
- Too much clutter
- Can't comply to manage multiple containers
- Can't recall the parameters again and again, where it is easy to save configs in a file.
- parameters clutter again and again in every execution, peculiar and relevant for each and every relevant options.
>**basic pod creation using imperative approach by passing commands and parameters in order to create an object/resource in Kubernetes cluster with the help of `kubectl` **

>nginx:latest. if nothing works, specify versions for not messing things up. WILL THROW A `IMAGEPULLBACK` ERROR. ++ -d, didn't work 
>Flags, -i = interactive, -t = tty, terminal, -- bash -> shell access / execution

>To take imperative commands to the next step know that you can modify resources by using the¬†[TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20text%2Dbased%20user,before%20the%20advent%20of%20bitmapped)¬†editor:  
By running¬†`kubectl edit -n [namespace] [resource-name]`¬†a text editor like the one below will open. Make you edits and close the editor just like in¬†[vim](https://www.vim.org/)¬†by running¬†`ESC + :q!`.

###### ACCESSING / ASSESSING A SHELL OF A POD's CONTAINER:
```
kubectl run -it <podname> --image=nginx:lts --restart=Always -- bash
```
*gets you into the shell of the POD's Container.* 
*cant use `kubectl`, `systemctl` or `service` commands here since it is whole other system.*

**test the container:**
```
curl localhost
```
will not run: due to the app is not running in the container.  To run the nginx inside the container,  gotta use some `cli` commands but can't use systemctl or service commands here. SINCE IT IS A CONTAINER NOT A SYSTEM ITSELF.
	Here, will be starting the `nginx`

EXECUTE NGINX POD $SHELL TO ENABLE NGINX.
syntax: nginx, -g = global, "" - params
```
nginx -g "daemon off; "
```
**NGINX TURNED ON**. and starts to run the web application.

Leave it as a process and open up an another terminal to exec IN PARELLEL & WATCH LOGS:
```
curl <podIP>
```
Prints nginx default page. + can see the request received in the side(logs).

> **We have successfully seen creating a Pod Object using both DECLARATIVE and IMPERATIVE**

After playing,
SIMPLY YOU CAN do a Cleanup / DISPOSE IT ALL. 
before that, exit the shell session, deletes only if u exit.

`ctrl + c`, `ctrl + d` and 
```
kubectl delete po <podname> 
kubectl delete po --all
```
```
kubectl get po -o wide #to verify the cleanup
```
> **THIS IS HOW YOU WORK WITH IMPERATIVE APPROACH**. SEE THE PAIN OF DOING ALL OF THESE. 
> **DECLARATIVE APPROACH IS A WISE CHOICE. SIMPLY WRITE IT ALL THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO CREATE, SIMPLY PASS THAT YAML AND VIOLA!**

 ***DECLARATIVE APPROACH = ALIGNS WELL WITH THE ORECHESTRATION CONCEPT***
