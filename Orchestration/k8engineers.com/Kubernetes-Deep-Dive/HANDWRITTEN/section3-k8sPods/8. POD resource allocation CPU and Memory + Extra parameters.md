#### 8. POD resource allocation CPU and Memory + Extra parameters
**POD resource allocation CPU and Memory + Extra parameters such as environment variables, resource blocks and more**

NOW, WILL DIG DEEPER INTO MORE PARAMETERS/FACTORS such as
1) allocating resources
 - CPU
 - Memory
 - storage and more
2) Environment variables
3) Resource limiting
4) Volume mounting in brief
5) Other blocks, such as
- Resource block
- port block

**Volume Block Demystification Overview:**
We have just worked on it bluntly. Will have an insight on how this works.
1) Volume of container's - Container Volume
-- which the name, and the `WORKDIR` path has been defined
2) Volume of Pod's - Shared Pod Volume
**Referring to the diagram:**
Container volume - named here as mounts that the name itself says that.
```
     volumeMounts:
      - name: hexr-vol
        mountPath: /var/wwww/html
```
Volume mount path that which of the directory that you want to expose.
-> Inside the container as we speak the CONTAINER VOLUME, we are performing mounting a `WORKDIR` folder which is exposed that to be mounted with
-> The Shared storage - Pod Volume. Mounted to what volume? 
   ```
volumes: 
    - name: hexr-vol
      emptyDir: {}
```
Volume of Pod's = Shared Storage - Pod Volume.  
>TO MAKE THE CONTAINER WORK WITH THE POD SHARED VOLUME, BOTH OF THE VOLUME NAMES MUST BE IDENTICAL. SAME STRING
> 
**Note: IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE CONTAINER VOLUME ON THE POSHARED VOULME TOO, IT IS MUST THAT *NAME* OF BOTH OF THE VOLUME  SHOULD BE IDENTICAL TO BE MAPPED** 
++
One more point to be noted that, in the 
POD Volume: emptyDir{} -> means that, wherever the pod gets launched on a particular HOST MACHINE and NODE, All these data must gets stored in some `WORKDIR` . For a Pod running in a node, the data get stored in a location - `kubelet`, the default working directory of a `kubelet` is `/var/lib/kubelet/`. Here all the POD related data gets stored here.  -> which is mapped as `emptyDir{}` here.
**WILL SEE MORE IN BRIEF WHEN WE DO THINGS HANDS-ON**.

BACK TO TOPIC! 
###### APPLYING THE SAME YAML TO UNDERSTAND POD RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN BRIEF.
RECALLING THE PERVIOUS `hexrapp.yaml` POD MANIFEST TO CONTNUE THE SAME.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hexrapp
  labels: 
    app: hexrapp
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: hexrapp
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      resources:
        limits: 
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "500Mi"
        requests:
          cpu: "200m"
          memory: "200Mi"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: hexrapp
          mountPath: /var/www/html
  volumes:
    - name: hexrapp
      emptyDir: {}
```
WE USED THIS MANIFEST TO LAUNCH A POD with One single container.
*Lets reuse the same and add parameters, sections, blocks, environment variables and resource allocation on top of it* How?
**All these params applied to Container section**
1) **Port block**
```
ports: #optional, proceeds with the default
 - name: hexr-port #naming the port block
   containerPort: 80 #port number specifiacatino
   protocol: TCP #none changes if not declared, goes default
```
2) **Environment Variables:**  
```
env:
  - name: DB_USER #name of the env var
    value: "admin" #value to that var
#creds to login after a successfull container launch, print env
```
3) **Resource Block:** by default, no resource limit has been defined. Amount of CPU and Memory to be utilized min or max (which is taken care of `cgroup` under the hood) Limiting the resource for the container. 
Why? One set of application must not get affected due to the over utilization of this app.
**Guide to resource limit:**
**limits**: # container should not use more than this, limit **(MAX LIMIT)**
1) cpu: "500m" # or 0.5  or 50% # 1core = 1000m(icrons) - 100%util 
2) memory: "500Mi" # Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti 
**requests**:  # how much resources to be allocated, in-demand **(MIN LIMIT)** required
1)  cpu: "200m" # core allocated
2) memory: "200Mi"  # memory allocated
```
resources:
  limits: 
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "500Mi"
  requests:
    cpu: "200m"
    memory: "200Mi"
```
4) **volumes:**
> HOST: `emptyDir: {}`<-mounted-> `/var/www/html` - WORKDIR of the container

**PASS THE MANIFEST TO SEE THE RESULTS.**
```
kubectl create -f app.yaml
kubectl get po -o wide
curl <podIP>
```
CHECK ALL THE METRICS PASSED,

**TO DO THAT, NEED TO LOG INTO THE CONTAINER. HOW TO LOG INTO THE CONTAINER**
```
kubectl exec -it hexrapp -c <containername(opt)> -- /bin/bash
```
VOILA! LOGGED IN! -> base machine of nginx -> `debian`  - basic cmds can be ran.
1) **environment variables:**
```
env
printenv
```
 All the ENV VAR can be shown. can find `DB_USER=admin`
2) **resources:**
```
kubectl describe no <nodenameorskip>
kubectl describe po <ponameorskip>
```
shows the specs and can verify the resources given there
3) **volumes:**
```
kubectl get po <containername> -o wide
sudo ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods
```
will show, ALL THE VOLUMES OF EACH OF THE PODS. **BUT, What we have is name, but here everything is in IDs. HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS**? IDs - UID
```
kubectl get po -o yaml
```
all these data came from `etcd` FYI.  Here, will filter out the volume as we need it.
```
kubectl get po -o yaml | grep "uid"
```
you get the `uid` of the pod.
```
sudo ls -l /var/lib/kubelet/pods/"uid"
```
THIS IS THE VOLUME MOUNT BETWEEN THE `container` and the `KUBELET`. Inside that `uid`,
```
kubernetes.io-empty-dir
kubernetes.io-projected
```
```
cd kubernetes.io-empty-dir
ls
<volume's-name>
```
>**TLDR**: SINCE BOTH ARE MOUNTED BIDIRECTIONAL, WHATEVER DATA WILL POPS UP ON, BOTH
>- /var/www/html - container
>- /var/lib/kubelet/pods/uid/kubernetes.io-empty-dir/volume-name/ -system

WILL SEE MORE ON THIS IN PRACTICE.
