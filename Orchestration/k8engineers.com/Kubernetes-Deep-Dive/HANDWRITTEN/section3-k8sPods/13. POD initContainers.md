###### How to write one? 
**NO ROCKET SCIENCE!** 
**JUST SIMPLE PARAMETERS GETS CHANGED HERE!** will see that in practice. 
Will get this by referring the diagram and understand how this `initContainer` works inside a POD in detail.
![[Pasted image 20240911181845.png]]
Here we are trying to create a Pod which has its own IP that communicates to your application where the frontier container is `nginx` here who serves content by acting as a server listening port 80. this how the communication happens. 

Here, we have an another container. WHY IS THIS HERE AND WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF IT. 

**Use case**: It has to contact my github, pull essential files and has to be stored in **/var/tmp** directory inside the container. 
WHICH IS MOUNTED TO THE **SHARED VOLUME** by default and it will be existed here too in the mounted directory which is
**/var/lib/kubelet/pods/'podUID'/volumes/kubernetes:emptyDir/**. 
	Once the process/job of pulling and storing the same gets completed, the **`initContainer`**'s status will be shown as and goes into completed state and gets terminated showing exit code as 0. IT IS A ONE TIME PROCESS AND AFTER IT GET COMPLETED, WE COULD ACCESS THE SAME.
where the `nginx`container will be shown as **Running** state in status since it is an application container.

Since the shared volume has the data which has been spawned by the `initContainer` which be seen in the `nginx` container's `WORKDIR` which is **/usr/share/nginx/html** too. which end up delivering the same content on the server too.
###### writing the same in a .yaml file. all the same but xtra parameters for initContainers:
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: init-container-pod
  labels:
    app: init-container-pod
    image: nginx
    type: web
    object: initContainer
spec:
#container-section
  containers:
  - name: web-container
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent #always, IfNotPresent, Never
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      name: http
      protocol: TCP
      hostPort: 8091
      hostIP: 192.168.0.222
    volumeMounts:
    - name: init-container-volume
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
#initContainer-section
#these containers will run first during pod initialization and will be stopped after pod creation
  initContainers:
  - name: init-container
    image: alpine
    command:
    - wget
    - -O
    - /var/tmp/index.html
    - https://github.com/sudheerduba/initContainer_demo/blob/main/index.html?raw=true #copy paste url + add ?raw=true to get raw content
    volumeMounts:
    - name: init-container-volume
      mountPath: /var/tmp
#where these containers secton has been written under spec section
#volumemount-section
  volumes:
  - name: init-container-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```
> - Will passing this pod manifest, `initcontainers` will get launched and gets into **completed** stage and done. 
> - After this one gets completed successfully, the rest of the containers will get launched and will be in **running** state.

**Here, will specifically focus on `initContainer`** 
```yaml
  initContainers:
  - name: init-container
    image: alpine
    command:
    - wget
    - -O
    - /var/tmp/index.html
    - https://github.com/sudheerduba/initContainer_demo/blob/main/index.html?raw=true #copy paste url + add ?raw=true to get raw content
    volumeMounts:
    - name: init-container-volume
      mountPath: /var/tmp
```

**Let see the same in practice passing this manifest to the cluster**: where we seek to launch two containers with a shared volume. one complete launching an `initContainer` first pulling a repo and and put that in its mounted working directory to get the container to a completed state and a regular `nginx` container where it serves the data which has been pulled and spawn by the `initContainer`.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: init-container-pod
  labels:
    app: init-container-pod
    image: nginx
    type: web
    object: initContainer
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      name: http
      protocol: TCP
      hostPort: 8091
      hostIP: 192.168.0.222
    volumeMounts:
    - name: init-container-volume
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
#these containers will run first during pod initialization and will be stopped after pod creation
  initContainers:
  - name: init-container
    image: alpine
    command:
    - wget
    - -O
    - /var/tmp/index.html
    - https://github.com/sudheerduba/initContainer_demo/blob/main/index.html?raw=true #copy paste url + add ?raw=true to get raw content
    volumeMounts:
    - name: init-container-volume
      mountPath: /var/tmp
  volumes:
  - name: init-container-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```
```
kubectl create -f initContainer-pod.yaml
```
pod gets created. verify the POD
```
kubectl get po -o wide
curl <PodIP>
```
Here, there is no sign of the `initContainers` right? to verify the same, do
```
kubectl describe po <PodName>
```
 showing:
     State:          Terminated
      Reason:       Completed
      Exit Code:    0
which means the initContainer 's objective has been successfully met. Job is done and gets deleted. Also, the events can be seen there too telling what are all have been happening over the process. To see the process in brief:
```
kubectl logs <podname> -c <initcontainername>
```
*Connecting to github.com (20.207.73.82:443)*
	*Connecting to github.com (20.207.73.82:443)*
	*Connecting to raw.githubusercontent.com (185.199.109.133:443)*

	*'/var/tmp/index.html' saved*
```
curl 10.244.114.58 
```
If any occurs while configuring the `initContainer` pod, it will show like
```
NAME             singlenode22                               
READY            0/1
STATUS           Init:0/1 or Error
RESTARTS         0 or 1(3s ago)
AGE              5h26m
IP               10.244.114.58
NODE             singlenode22 
NOMINATED NODE   none
READINESS GATES  none
```
can verify the same errors in logs by giving,
```
kubectl describe po <podname> 
kubectl log <podname> -c <containername>
```
describe: shows what sup! events, errors, state, reason, logs and the exit code:1
logs: shows what sup with the resources specifically.
> and troubleshoot the same, make changes and redeploy!
```
kubeetl replace --force -f initContainerPodManifestFile.yaml
kubectl get po -o wide
```
and you are good to go and check by `curl`ing it!
