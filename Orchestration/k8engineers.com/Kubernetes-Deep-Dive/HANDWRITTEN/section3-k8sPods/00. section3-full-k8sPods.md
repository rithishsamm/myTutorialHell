Kubernetes Objects overview:
**Terminologies**:
> **Objects**: also previously has been named or called as service, components. Primarily, it is called as Kubernetes objects. 
>  IF I WANT TO CREATE ANYTHING ON KUBERNETES CLUSTER, CALLED AS OBJECTS. 

Will see what are all the objects that are available in Kubernetes Cluster. Objects can also be named as **workloads**.  

> ultimately we're using Kubernetes Cluster to deploy applications. While deploying, we use objects to make things happen.

E.g.:  
#### Approaches to deploy application on K8s Cluster,
using objects or workloads such as pods, config maps, secrets, network policy's, and other relevant resources -> a.k.a objects. 

Eg: 
Workloads  -->  Pod, Replication Controller/ReplicaSet, Deployment Set, DaemonSet, Stateful sets and Jobs.
These are named as Workloads because, you are deploying application on Kubernetes Cluster are of simply these objects. Simply a Pod or the rest of the object.

You have to create any one of them to deploy any one of the application on a kubernetes cluster. = Objects

**Objects**: Except all the workloads, whatever that gets created are know as objects, such as 
- All the workloads itself, 
- Service, (people were getting confused about this service and the object as service)
- ConfigMap/ Secrets,
- Ingress, 
- Network policy, 
- PV, PVC and Storage Classes, etc..  
> **previously, these has been called out as SERVICE - Legacy**

So! all of these here are all **OBJECTS**.
> THIS IS EXPLAINED HERE TO GET HABITUATED AND CLARITY ON THESE OBJECTS AND WORKLOADS.

>**Now, WILL SEE MORE ON PODS**
Will see answers for,
- what
- why (creating one in the first place)
- how (to use)
- benefits of a pod (rather than container tools)
- and more..

---
#### 2. POD overview
POD overview:
After getting know all about the Kubernetes Architecture and setting up, we gotta see at first is PODS.

Why? 
PODS: Whatever you seek to deploy on a Kubernetes Cluster, it going to end up in a POD. Any workload, any objects, any components, will be all in a POD. That Pod creates containers. 
> SO IT IS ESSNTIAL AND NECCESSARY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT **PODS** IN DEEP. if this is not understandable, you'll never become devops guy deploying applications on a Kubernetes Cluster.

 Will see Pods in detail, 
> [!NOTE] **What is a POD**
> -  Pod **creates a logical layer** 
> to group 1 or more containers =  to have common network + shared storage.
> - Pod has a unique IP address assigned from `--pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16`
> - Containers inside those POD talks to each other on `localhost` domain or `127.0.0.1`, since container share the same network stack. 
> - Containers share data inside POD.
> - In general, we need to create containers inside POD 
> which are dependent, not different application. 
1. why a logical layer to create one or more containers? to have common network and storage. will see that in brief.
2. here, this argument in specific, `--pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16`, when we executed `kubeadm init` command, to create single, multi or HA nodes for kubernetes setup. here `--pod-network-cidr=ip/block`. **If i want to reach the application inside the POD, have to use POD IP Address not the container IP Address.**
The Pods IP Address is an ephemeral IP ADDRESS - Not fixed to the pod. If Pod gets removed so the IP Address too. If a new one gets deployed, it won't be or get the same even when you deploy the exact same app. Just like DHCP where IP gets assigned in random. Here, it does the same but under a CIDR Block. but still that isn't fixed.
3. Containers will talk to each other mostly on loopback interface -  `localhost` `127.0.0.1`. no matter the machine such as bare metal, vm, cloud instance or containers. - Loop back interface. **CONTAINERS INSIDE THE POD WILL TALK VIA `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as you call it .**
WHY? e.g.: Inside a POD you have multiple containers for an application or any workload, ALL OF THESE SHARE THE SAME NAMESPACE. ESPECIALLY NETWORK NAMESPACE. SO, IF ==YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE TO AN APPLICATION OUTSIDE THE POD, WE NEED **POD's IP ADDRESS**, *NOT CONTAINERS*. INSIDE THAT POD, CONTAINERS WILL TALK TO EACH OTHER ON `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.==
4. Incase if we have multiple containers inside a POD, I might want to replicate data among all the containers inside the pod. Here comes the **SHARED STORAGE**. (As we discussed in 1st Point). To achieve shared storage, have to use the concept of POD. 
-> The reason why we use PODs not plain containers is this. Common Network and Shared storage.
5. One app in a POD which can be either in a single or multi-containers, not a whole different application. Containers that are relevant to the application is recommended. Though, you can but IT WILL BE CLUNKY if it is all different. 
###### Architecture of a POD:
1) **Common Network:**
![[Pasted image 20240821105001.png]]
POD -> Common network namespace -> Containers under that namespace (sharing same network which can talk bidirectional via `localhost`, not matter how many containers in a pod, shares the same namespace). 
WHY? Benefits of Common network. If need to communicate outside the POD, can use **POD IP Address.** 
- Communication within or between containers - `localhost` x `127.0.0.0`
- Communication outside containers - `Pod IP Address`


2) **Shared Storage:**
![[Pasted image 20240821105656.png]]
POD -> Pod network namespace -> Containers under that namespace -> Shares same volume which is a Shared Storage. 
Shared Storage - Containers that are sitting inside the POD shares data between the containers in common. 
WHY? Benefits of Shared Storage. Data that comes to that POD which can be shared in common between containers inside that POD. 
eg: One container that hold or contains some data within, It will be housed on or under that common volume which is shared storage. Which that can be used by another container too. Sharing User credentials for IAM between containers services for a common application for example.

==Having Common Network and Shared storage for one or more containers in a namespace, we can achieve the concept of POD. The reason for using PODs not plain containers in Kubernetes is this.

>**Pod is simply a logical layer. Programmatically, It is simply having one container or grouping multiple container together to have a common network and shared storage. ==**

SETUP:
1) 2 VMs,
- One Control Plane - 2vCPU, 2GB Ram, 12GB Storage
- One worker Node - same
2) Visual Studio Code
3) Install Remote-SSH Extension
**Objective**: WANT TO WRITE KUBERNETES YAML FILES FROM HERE FOR ALL THE ESSENTIAL SETUP ON THESE VIRTUAL MACHINES.

Taking VM in remote and making YAML Manifests instead of inside the machine since it is only CLI. So, Write in local , Execute in remote

Visual Studio Code -> SSH Icon -> Open SSH Configuration File -> open terminal and land in `c:\users\username\.ssh\` 
```
ssh-keygen.exe
<enter>empty
y
<enter>empty - no passphrase
```
Key got generated. Copy public key fingerprint to that machine. 
```
ssh-copy-key username@ip
```
> DOING **PASSWORD-LESS KEY-BASED AUTH** instead of **PASSWORD BASED AUTH**

SSH -> Connect to Host -> add hosts `username@ip` -> add config -> Connect back to host. Voila!

**SMOOTH AS BUTTER!**

#### 4. Overview on k8s objects creation using imperative and declarative approach

Overview on k8s objects creation using imperative and declarative approach

**APPROCHES TO CREATE OBJECTS ON K8s**: there are two approaches,
`kubectl` : 
e.g.: executing `kubectl`, need to create some objects on our Kubernetes Cluster. Not just pod by deployment, services, state sets and more. HOW TO CREATE SUCH OBJECTS?
- **Declarative approach** -  Declaring the same by giving all the required objects by writing it in a `YAML` File.
This YAML will be given via `kubectl`to the `api-server` that takes cares of the rest by receiving it, doing schema validation and passed information to the `etcd` that talks to  its relevant components in order to create all the same which we've declared in the manifests.
- **Imperative approach -**  Creating resources from the CLI itself. giving it all in our CLI as commands to create objects. No YAML or JSON files excepts systems, services and components needs and manifests. 
eg: If using 
- docker with cli - imperative approach
- writing docker-compose file in YAML - Declarative approach.
Here in `kubectl`, can use both of these approaches. 

###### Understanding Declarative Approach: (!IMP - using irl)
![[Pasted image 20240821182425.png]]
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: nginx-demo
 labels:
  app: nginx
  env: prod
spec:
 containers:
   -name: nginx
    image: nginx:lts #latesttag
   ports:
   - name: nginx-port
     containerPort: 80
     protocol: TCP
   env:
    -name: USERNAME
     value: "admin"
   resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "0.2"
      memory: "500Mi" #Ki,Mi,Gi,Ti
     requests:
      cpu: "0.2"
      memory: "200Mi"
    volumeMounts:
     -name: nginx-data
      mountPath: /var/www/html
volumes:
 - name: nginx-data
   emptyDir: {}
```
1. `apiVersion`: ==version of the object. max v3==, *version of what are all the objects that are going to get created.* (will see more on the same by how to confirm and verify the same)
2. `kind`: Object/ Resource name -> ==Kind of object== ,*what object that i want to create*
3. `metadata`:  ==metadata to the object for labeling each, useful for filtering== *name that i want to assign to my POD*, *adding additional information by labeling the object for further identification and filtration by specifying relevant key word.* volumes, containers, init-containers and more. Specifying how many containers i want to create, all the relevant parameters to that containers, - naming it, image, assigning port, passing env variables, resources specs, volume mounting
- name: nginx-demo
- labels: (***app***: nginx, ***env***: prod)
5. `specs`: ==container specifications to be handles by the POD== *specifying what are all the things that i want to create*, 
- containers:
-  -- name: nginx
-  - image: nginx:lts ==tag==
-  - ports (***-name***: nginx-port, ***containerPort***: 80, ***protocol***: TCP) ==container ports section== 
- - env (***-name***: db_username , ***value***: "admin") ==container environment variables== 
- - resources: (***limits***: ***cpu***: "1" ***memory***: "500Mi", ***requests***: ***cpu***: "0.5" ***memory***: "200Mi" ) ==container resource allocation== 
- - volumeMounts: (***-name***: nginx-data, ***mountPath***: /var/www/html) ==container volume mounting point== 
- `volumes`: ==shared volume for POD Containers== 
- --name: nginx-data
- emptyDir:  {}
ALL `compose.yaml` CONTENT.

###### Understanding Imperative Approach: (opt)
Imperative approach is all the same by giving commands. creating each by imperative will be much of a pain So, Why Imperative even exist. 
Helps in,
- smaller operations
- frequent object creation
- patchwork
- operation intensive works
- depends on the circumstances and condition, usage may vary.
BUT IN MOST OF OUR TIME, **==DECLARATIVE APPROACH IS STAGNENT==**. REST OF THE CONDITIONS, imperative.
---
#### 5.POD creation using Declarative approach
Creating YAML Manifests in the VM. Declarative approach.

Before moving forward, will check on these prerequisites,
1) become a `root` user, to use `kubectl` in ease.
```
sudo -i
```
2) setup up all the kubernetes base setup. 
- all the updates
- reboot after initial spin up
- network configuration for `containerd`, `kubernetes-cri` 
- apply the configuration
- installing `containerd` 
- docker's `gpg`, `apt resources`, `containerd` installation and config, `restart` service
- `crictl` config
- installing `kubeadm`, `kubectl`, `kubelet`
- `gpg` keys and `apt` Dir for them
- `enable` and `hold` it all.
- `kubeadm init` for Control plane, `kubeadm join` for Worker node
-setup all done from here until you get something like this.

```
kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address=192.168.0.219 --cri-socket=/run/containerd/containerd.sock --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!
To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:
```
kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address=192.168.0.219 --cri-socket=/run/containerd/containerd.sock --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```
Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:
```
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.config
```
You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run 
```
kubeadm apply -f <pod-network>.yaml
```
with one of the options listed at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/
Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:
```
kubeadm join 192.168.0.219:6443 --token xljegf.3d6nt61xmqk33qns \ --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:968164ba40787980ba10adf93b13abe8adf22e6a10b65a3fad0fdc574941ce7b
```
if any error in the process, 
- clear cache
- rm /.kube/config and respawn it
- ensure disabling `swap` memory
- make sure that `kubelet` is running, enable if not.
- also ensure, kube `cni` configured properly
- end, `kubeadm reset`.
```shell
sudo systemctl enable --now kubelet
```
```shell
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.0/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.0/manifests/custom-resources.yaml 

nano custom-resources.yaml ##change-cidr
```
```
kubectl apply -f custom-resources.yaml 
```
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```
> `kubeadm init` again

**MOVING FORWARD WITH *DECLARATIVE APPROACH* BY USING A `YAML` FILE.** 

vscode -> open folder -> Home folder + Open the same in terminal too.
> STORING ALL THE YAML MANIFESTs IN THE HOME DIRECTORY, now the DECLARATIVE APPROACH of creating PODS.

```
cd ~
mkdir manifests
cd manifests
mkdir PODs
cd PODs
touch hexrapp.yaml
```
ALL IN `vs-code`

says: 
- NAME  - system default name gets applied
- STATUS  - Ready or not-ready
- ROLES - control plane or worker node
- AGE - days of creation
- VERSION - version
- INTERNAL-IP - IP that we configured
- EXTERNAL-IP - will be configured after worker gets joined
- OS-IMAGE - Ubuntu or any image
- KERNEL-VERSION - Kernel's version 
- CONTAINER-RUNTIME - cri used in k8s, containerd.docker or whatever runtimes.

##### Objective:
> **Here in this cluster, I want to create a POD using declarative approach.**
THE OBJECTIVE NOW HERE IS TO CREATE PODs IN THE NODE.

###### To-do: 
- Create a `yaml` file
- where? ~/manifests/pod/ -> manage manifests files in a separate directory 
- touch `app.yaml`
- also store the file in root too. 
- sudo -i
```
mkdir /home/username/.kube
cp .kube/config /home/username/.kube
chown -R testuser: /home/testuser/.kube
exit #root
```
now execute kubectl commands.
```
kubectl get no -o wide
```
> NOW, THE USER CAN ALSO ABLE TO GET THE WORK DONE BY EXECUTING `kubectl` COMMANDS with the help of that config file here and there!

###### Parameters:
Here, What to use for POD creation? check the same: Writing the same on a `YAML` file -> pass it to `kubectl` -> that to the `kube-api-server`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hexrapp-demo
  labels:
    app: nginx
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hexrapp
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
```
As we saw previously,  ++to find all the relevant options to declare in `yaml` file, refer context given below for your reference,
1. **apiVersion**
defining `apiVersion` - what version of object i have to use,
```
apiVersion: v1
```

2. **kind**
`kind` - kind of object to use to create the object 
> here it is **`Pod`**. refer that in `api-resources` to declare the version of it.
```
kind: Pod
```

3. **metadata**
naming and labelling the `pod` using `metadata`, two spaces. adding labels by passing parameters. naming it & labelling it-
> # you can pass multiple params to those labels, which doesn't affect the pod behavior, doesn't change the application in anyways. labels are all just metadata. just an additional info to the pods. To filter, to gather information and more. nothing will happen if it didn't even exist but `name` is mandatory.
> labels for `Pod` the list goes on. versions, annotations, namespaces and so many parameters which you can declare as per your requirement. here we are good with `name` and `labels`.

`metadata`: `
  `name`: appname, # any name, mandatory
   `labels`: # are optional
		app: nginx
	    env: prod
```yaml
metadata:
  name: hexrapp-demo
  labels:
    app: nginx
    env: prod
```

4.  **spec**
specifications, that you want to pass for your `Pod`. First is nothing but `containers`. Declaring all the containers that I want to create. 2spaces + hyphen.
>Since, Pod is just a logical layer, `containers` are the same as we use with common network and shared storage, under the layer of `Pod` 

`spec`:
  `containers`: 
     - `name`: frontend # name of the container, not the pod since we gave it in `metadata`
       `image`: nginx:lts # `image` of this container + `version` as tag
       `ports`: # though not important but mandatory
       - `containerPort`: 80 # default nginx port, even if isn't declared, proceeds with default.
       `volumeMount`:
       - `name`: hexr-vol # name of the volume
        `mountpath`: /var/www/html # volume path, whatever gets here saved in 
        `volumes`:
         - name: hexrapp # name of the volume
         emptyDir: {} 
  # parameter that binds the container's volume to the pods shared storage volume. will make sense when we work with this, will see more in future. 
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hexrapp
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMount:
    - name: hexrapp
      mountPath: /var/www/html
  volumes:
  - name: hexrapp
    emptyDir: {}
```
**How to apply the `yaml` file, to create the pod**, simply practicing declarative approach by applying this `yaml` file to the kubernetes cluster.  HOW TO DO THAT? this `yaml` file has to get to the `kube-apiserver` HOW?
`kubectl` - **create**, **apply**. x2
1) Does a **schema validation** first,
2) Applies the `yaml` file next.
3) pod gets created.
```
kubectl create -f /path/of/hexrapp.yaml
```
```
kubectl apply -y hexrapp.yaml
```
**To verify such pods**
```
kubectl get po/pod/pods #shows pods
kubectl describe po/pod/pods #describes pod in detail 
```
Here, 
- Name: hexrapp # name of the pod
- Ready: 0/1 # expected, actual (running and ready) state vs desired state
- Status: Pending/Running/Stopped # status
- Restarts: 0 
- Age: # pod created time 
> `ready` has to be 1/1 equal to = `status` if it is in Running state.


>++ TROUBLESHOOT IF ANY ERROR OCCURS OR IF ANY MISMATCH OCCURS.
>Possible errors and troubleshoot methods:
>`describe` pods and nodes and check the message troubleshooting the same.
>curl the IP.
