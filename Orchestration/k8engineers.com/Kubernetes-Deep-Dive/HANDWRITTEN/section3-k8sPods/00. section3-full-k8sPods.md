Kubernetes Objects overview:
**Terminologies**:
> **Objects**: also previously has been named or called as service, components. Primarily, it is called as Kubernetes objects. 
>  IF I WANT TO CREATE ANYTHING ON KUBERNETES CLUSTER, CALLED AS OBJECTS. 

Will see what are all the objects that are available in Kubernetes Cluster. Objects can also be named as **workloads**.  

> ultimately we're using Kubernetes Cluster to deploy applications. While deploying, we use objects to make things happen.

E.g.:  
#### Approaches to deploy application on K8s Cluster,
using objects or workloads such as pods, config maps, secrets, network policy's, and other relevant resources -> a.k.a objects. 

Eg: 
Workloads  -->  Pod, Replication Controller/ReplicaSet, Deployment Set, DaemonSet, Stateful sets and Jobs.
These are named as Workloads because, you are deploying application on Kubernetes Cluster are of simply these objects. Simply a Pod or the rest of the object.

You have to create any one of them to deploy any one of the application on a kubernetes cluster. = Objects

**Objects**: Except all the workloads, whatever that gets created are know as objects, such as 
- All the workloads itself, 
- Service, (people were getting confused about this service and the object as service)
- ConfigMap/ Secrets,
- Ingress, 
- Network policy, 
- PV, PVC and Storage Classes, etc..  
> **previously, these has been called out as SERVICE - Legacy**

So! all of these here are all **OBJECTS**.
> THIS IS EXPLAINED HERE TO GET HABITUATED AND CLARITY ON THESE OBJECTS AND WORKLOADS.

>**Now, WILL SEE MORE ON PODS**
Will see answers for,
- what
- why (creating one in the first place)
- how (to use)
- benefits of a pod (rather than container tools)
- and more..

#### 2. POD overview
POD overview:
After getting know all about the Kubernetes Architecture and setting up, we gotta see at first is PODS.

Why? 
PODS: Whatever you seek to deploy on a Kubernetes Cluster, it going to end up in a POD. Any workload, any objects, any components, will be all in a POD. That Pod creates containers. 
> SO IT IS ESSNTIAL AND NECCESSARY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT **PODS** IN DEEP. if this is not understandable, you'll never become devops guy deploying applications on a Kubernetes Cluster.

 Will see Pods in detail, 
> [!NOTE] **What is a POD**
> -  Pod **creates a logical layer** 
> to group 1 or more containers =  to have common network + shared storage.
> - Pod has a unique IP address assigned from `--pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16`
> - Containers inside those PODS talks to each other on `localhost` `127.0.0.1`, since container share the same network stack.
1. why a logical layer to create one or more containers? to have common network and storage. will see that in brief.
2. here, this argument in specific, `--pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16`, when we executed `kubeadm init` command, to create single, multi or HA nodes for kubernetes setup. here `--pod-network-cidr=ip/block`. **If i want to reach the application inside the POD, have to use POD IP Address not the container IP Address.**
The Pods IP Address is an ephemeral IP ADDRESS - Not fixed to the pod. If Pod gets removed so the IP Address too. If a new one gets deployed, it won't be or get the same even when you deploy the exact same app. Just like DHCP where IP gets assigned in random.  
3. Containers will talk to each other mostly on loopback interface -  `localhost` `127.0.0.1` WHY? eg: Inside a POD you have multiple container
