Kubernetes Objects overview:

**Terminologies**:
> **Objects**: also previously has been named or called as service, components. Primarily, it is called as Kubernetes objects. 
>  IF I WANT TO CREATE ANYTHING ON KUBERNETES CLUSTER, CALLED AS OBJECTS. 

Will see what are all the objects that are available in Kubernetes Cluster. Objects can also be named as **workloads**.  

> ultimately we're using Kubernetes Cluster to deploy applications. While deploying, we use objects to make things happen.

E.g.:  
#### Approaches to deploy application on K8s Cluster,
using objects or workloads such as pods, config maps, secrets, network policy's, and other relevant resources -> a.k.a objects. 

Eg: 
Workloads  -->  Pod, Replication Controller/ReplicaSet, Deployment Set, DaemonSet, Stateful sets and Jobs.
These are named as Workloads because, you are deploying application on Kubernetes Cluster are of simply these objects. Simply a Pod or the rest of the object.

You have to create any one of them to deploy any one of the application on a kubernetes cluster. = Objects
