###### Multi-container pod with Shared Volume - [Doc](obsidian://open?vault=tutorialHell&file=Orchestration%2Fk8engineers.com%2FKubernetes-Deep-Dive%2Foffl-raw-docs%2Fkubernetes%20deepdive%2Fsec3-k8s-pods%2F5.Multicontainer%20pod%20with%20Shared%20Volume.docx)
SPINNING MULTI-CONTAINER POD WITH SHARED VOLUME. SAME AS BEFORE SPINNING A SINGLE CONTAINER IN A POD BUT HERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE BUT XTRA VOLUME FOLDERS.

Will see a pictorial view:
![[Pasted image 20240830105402.png]]
Here, We have a node. Inside that,
Node --> Pod with an IP (with two containers)--> nginx + alpine } -> 
> If we got to access the container, no container IP can be resolved since each of the container can be communicated, only via the POD IP alone. Inside that IP, both can talk to each other only on its own `locahost`s or `127.0.0.1`. 
==req -> PodIP -> nginxport80 + alpine22 -> container's data lands on its own volumes -> which will be stored also in the `volumemount` under systems.==

e.g.: here, we have a pod with two containers. one nginx which serves data, one alpine which writes data. each `workdir` gets mounted on system's volume mount.
- nginx port80-> /usr/share/nginx/html -> /var/lib/kubelet/podUID/volumes
- alpine port80-> /var/tmp/`whateverdata` -> /var/lib/kubelet/podUID/volumes
=> based on this logic, will deploy an application works this way which helps and used in many cases. POD with multi-container.

**Moral: A single storage volume can be stored and serve data to multiple containers. Just like other infra models such as VMs and On-prems. Same logic can be applied to multi-container pod**

Will see that in practice. 
`multicontainer-pod.yaml` 
> Note: without defining apiVersion, rest of the parameters such as `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata` and `spec` can't be defined and wont be passed to K8s. 
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hexrapp
  labels:
    app: hexrapp
    type: web
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hexrapp-writer
    image: alpine
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
      mountPath: /var/tmp
  - name: hexrapp-server
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:                  
  - name: hexrapp-shared-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```
>   containers:
	   - ...
	    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 30; done"]
	    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo $(date) >> /var/tmp/hexrapp.log; sleep 1; done"]

> Here in this image, if i have to perform any actions such as passing cmds, running processes, functions of jobs. it is possible using `command` param under `spec`. 
> 
> This can be a single or a combo of commands. It is more like **`ENTRYPOINT`** in Dockerfile, if we compare the same with docker. As same, there is an another named **`args`** param which works similar to **`CMD`**.

`command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 30; done"]`
`args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]`

**Decoding this param:**  
**`command`**: helps us access the shell of that image. **/bin/bash**
**`args`**: runs cmd's inside that image since we accessed the shell. in this, we are looking forward to run a command every ten seconds. to apply that logic,
**running an infinity while loop running a command with setting up a timer.**  
    **`args`**: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/tmp/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
1. `"-c", `= indicates that we are passing cmds
2. `"while true` = "cmd of while loop starting and declare the same where it is true in condition. 
3. `;`is followed by next steps.
4. `do date` = do  - passes command that whatever we declare. here we pass date. 
5. `>> /var/tmp/index.html;`  = passing that to where?, >> - towards a file or dir. 
6. `sleep 10;` - sleep command helps pause running a command for the time we define. here 10 seconds. every 10secs the command gets executed.
7. `done"` - closing that loop following by.

Now, lets check the rest.
```
kubectl get po -o wide #checking pod status
curl ip #check output, prints date and time every 10secs
kubectl describe po podname #shows all the details
```
while describing the pod:
`kubectl describe po podname` shows all the container details. We have spun up two containers, **one generates data** and **one serves it**. 
- 1 container runs a while loop printing date every ten seconds passes it to the **/var/tmp/index.html** file. whatever that stores in that `index.html` file (which that i sotre it in that volume), gets used on.
- another 1 container which prints that data to web.
-> this became possible with the help of `volumeMount` which shares data in between.
>THE MULTI-CONTAINER POD WITH VOLUME SHARING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED.
