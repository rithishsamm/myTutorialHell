This part's context is mostly based out of this documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/

Here, it briefly explains about
1) What is HASetup
2) How to configure
3) Prerequisites 
4) and measures to be considered
#### Before we begin[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/#before-you-begin)
The prerequisites depend on which topology that we have selected for our cluster's control plane, there are two:
1) Stacked etcd
2) External etcd
the names says itself. Here, we will be using stacked vanilla etcd. `etcd` will be a part of our control plane nodes.

Ensure that our HAProxy LoadBalancer instance is reachable or not from the Control Plane EC2. 
```
ping #HAProxy's IP
```
```
nc -v #HAProxy's IP 6443
```

  IT SHOULD THROW 
```
connection to <HAPorxy'sIP> 6443 port[tcp/*] successded!  
```
>==DO THE SAME FOR ALL THE CONTROL PLANE NODES TOO!==
>IF it throws error in anyway, There must be an error configuring HAProxy node or on the AWS Security Group Rules.

Out of these three control plane nodes, i need to bootstrap one node. *Applies to any cluster whether it is a DB, Webserver, Cache, Big Data Haddop and more* ANY CLUSTER BY ANY MEANS ANY FORM. Th concept of ==**BOOTSTRAPPING**== APPLIES TO ALL. 
> ==**BOOTSTRAPPING**== IS A TERM THAT IN A CLUSTER LIKE ENVIRONMENT, TAKING ALL THESE COMPONENTS IN ORDER TO LAUNCH FOR PREFLIGHT CHECK AND DEPLOY YOUR WORKLOADS.

Here, will bring these clusters for both control plane node and compute plane node. In control plane node, we'll be bringing up only one node. The process of bringing up and getting things together in prior on the frontier for a launch is called **BOOTSTRAPPING**

Other nodes will be joining in the cluster such as other control planes, Load balancers or worker nodes to the frontier **bootstrapping control plane node**.
##### Stacked control plane and etcd nodes[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/#stacked-control-plane-and-etcd-nodes)
Steps for the first control plane node[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/#steps-for-the-first-control-plane-node)
1. Initialize the control plane:
syntax:
```sh
sudo kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint "LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT" --upload-certs
```
```sh
sudo kubeadm init --control-plane-endpoint "HAPROXY pvt IP":6443 --upload-certs
```

- `--control-plane-endpoint` flag should be set to the address or DNS and port of the load balancer.
- `--upload-certs` flag is used to upload the certificates that should be shared across all the control-plane instances to the cluster.

Ensure that HAProxy EC2 node is
