This part's context is mostly based out of this documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/

Here, it briefly explains about
1) What is HASetup
2) How to configure
3) Prerequisites 
4) and measures to be considered
#### Before we begin[](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/#before-you-begin)
The prerequisites depend on which topology that we have selected for our cluster's control plane, there are two:
1) Stacked etcd
2) External etcd
the names says itself. Here, we will be using stacked vanilla etcd. 

Ensure that our HAProxy LoadBalancer instance is reachable from the Control Plane EC2 or not. 
```
ping #HAProxy's IP
