Will log into all these nodes and configure the same + installing K8 Components such as container runtime interface, kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl to end up having kubeadm join command.

1) SSH into a worker node 1 & 2:
Mobaxterm -> Create Session -> SSH -> IP + Username + Key ->Login
2) All all the same for all the EC2 nodes + Split screen with Multi-Exec mode
3) Exclude all the multi-exec except two Worker Nodes
4) Root into those worker nodes
Worker Nodes setup:
1) root
```sh
su root
```
 2) apt update and upgrade
```sh
 apt update && apt upgrade -y
```
3)
