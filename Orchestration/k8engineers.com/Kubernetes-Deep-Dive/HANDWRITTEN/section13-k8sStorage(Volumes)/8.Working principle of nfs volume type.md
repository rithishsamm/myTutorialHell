**`NFS`: Working principle of `nfs` volume types**. *important VolumeType.* 
Will cover what `nfs` VolumeType and have an `nfs` server separately somewhere and how to mount with the same using this `nfs`, which is **network file system**.

Will see setting up `nfs` which will run as another environment, here VM, Will expose directories to mount and making it work by sharing data across environments. 
 

![[nfs]]

As per this diagram having deployment object, the POD's volume will be mounted to a server **sharing common data** in between across node, 

 These ain't possible with what we have seen in the previous `VolumeType`. 

==With the diagrams, each container happened to have a  **==share data across node==** wherever your pods are running. - **nfs** - network server. Will be deploying this one on as a separate server. In order to use `nfs`, have to install package to make this one work. ==
