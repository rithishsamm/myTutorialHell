# Section 13: K8s Storage (Volumes)
# 1. Introduction to Kubernetes Storage types

The next very important topic in this K8s - Storage (Volumes)
	Which is so critical for applications and for the clusters. Especially for **Applications** running on clusters. 

What's is in it?
First, need to know about 
- Volumes (followed by)
- Persistent Volumes (pv) (and the differences),
- Static and dynamic persistent volumes
- Persistent volume claim (pvc)
- Static and dynamic persistent volume claims
- Storage class
And more storage types such as,
- Volume expansion (volume scaling)  
- Volumes snapshot
- Dynamic Volume provisioning
- And more advanced storage types. 

To start with storage. Will get familiar with volumes and proceed to more advanced types as we listed above. 

And see more of 
- When to use it,
- Where to use it,
- And use cases. 

Lets get started with volumes,

# 2. Overview on Kubernetes Volumes
Overview on Kubernetes Volumes - [Doc]

Volumes -
- Purpose of volumes,
- Why volumes for the workload resources
- When to use
- Where to use
- Limitations of volumes 
- Pros and cons of volumes
- Volumes for both Pods and also the Containers

==**Volumes for Pods are persistent . 
Volumes for containers are ephemeral.**==
Will dig in deep about storage and volumes in brief. 
- In general, containers are **ephemeral** which files will be lost once a containers crashes.
-  Since kubelet restarts containers which comes with clean state data will be lost. 
- When we want to **share data** across container inside the POD, we can use volumes.
- When containers restarts with clean state, POD volume will help to persist the data. Since POD uses volumes as persistent storage solution for containers. 
- Container mounts directory under `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts` to volumes under `.spec.volumes` with common name.
- K8s supports two types of volumes,
	- Ephemeral volumes (emptyDir,  configMap, secret, downwardAPI, CSI ephemeral volumes. Etc.,)
	- Persistent volumes (PV -> Static and dynamic with StorageClass)
- Volume types supported by K8s,
	- AWS EBS CSI
	- AzureDisk CSI, [[azure_disk]]
	- GCE CSI
	- vSphere CSI
	- CephFS, rbd
	- ConfigMap, secret, downwardAPI, hostPath
	- iSCSI, local, NFS [[nfs-server-setup]]
	- PVC
	- Projected

###### In general, containers are ephemeral which files will be lost once a containers crashes.
Eg: 
- take a POD.
- No matter if it is a standalone or workload resource based POD.
- And that POD contains containers. 
- Container1, Container2
- Until a container gets recreated, the data will be on that container. 
- If a container crashes, data crashes and lost. Where `kubelet` tries to recreate the POD and along with containers. from scratch (like creating a new VM, so the configurations, data's and volumes)
That way containers - ephemeral volumes. Till a container is alive, the data will be alive.  

Once a container goes down, `kubelet` will recreate a new container which results in losing data. 

######  Since kubelet restarts containers which comes with clean state data will be lost. 
Since kubelet restarts containers which comes with clean state data will be lost. -> `kubelet` doesn't restarts the container. It recreates. 

Like in docker, docker container stop -> rm -> run. Not docker restart.  Only recreation, no restarts. Again, which results in losing data creating a new container. 
>  cannot use as persistent volumes, cannot store the data persistently. Cannot modify the configs or the containers itself when the storage is ephemeral.   

###### When we want to share data across  container inside the POD, we can use volumes.
To **share data** across container inside the POD, -> use ==volumes==. 

If we recall the definition of PODs. [[00. section3-full-k8sPods]]] 

> [!NOTE] **What is a POD**
> - ==Pod **creates a logical layer**  
>     to group 1 or more containers = to have **common network** + **shared storage.**==
> - Pod has a unique IP address assigned from `--pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16`
> - Containers inside those POD talks to each other on `localhost` domain or `127.0.0.1`, since container share the same network stack.
> - Containers share data inside POD.
> - In general, we need to create containers inside POD  
>     which are dependent, not different application.

> Point to recall - Pod **creates a logical layer**  
    to group 1 or more containers = to have **common network** + **shared storage.**

The term **shared storage** means here is that -> We can share the data
- **across containers** ->  **inside the PODs.** 
Eg: like what we have done with the **nginx-multicontainer** - `deploy.yaml`

Where we saw two container's working directory, sharing same volumes out of PODs `EmptyDir()` volume.  
![[PodvsContainerStorage]]
**Purpose/Objective:** Volumes used inside the Pod to share the data across the containers. 
**Benefit:** 
- Shared volume across containers inside a POD (using `EmptyDir()`). 
- If a container gets crashed and gets recreated freshly from scratch inside the POD, the data will be persistent not get washed.  (*Data will not be lost which that came out of that dead container, where the volume didn't get deleted.*)
- Where the volume will be deleted if the POD gets deleted, not the container.
> Volumes - a shared storage volume solution to work with the data of the containers inside the POD. 

###### When containers restarts with `clean state`, POD volume will help to persist the data. Since POD uses volumes as persistent storage solution for containers. 
When containers restarts with **clean state**, *POD volume will help to persist the data.*

Since POD uses volumes as persistent storage solution for containers which we just discussed in the above point.  

The core part of the volume is that to share the volume, to provision a persistent storage. Even if it gets crashed and recreated, the volume will not be lost. 

**==For container -  it is a persistent storage, 
For POD - its ephemeral 
where if the POD gets f'ed up and so the volumes too.==**  


###### Container mounts directory under `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts` to volumes under `.spec.volumes` with common name.

Volume mounting - Container mounts directory under 
> -  `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts` - **Containers**
> - to volumes under `.spec.volumes` with common name.


###### K8s supports two types of volumes,
 - **Ephemeral volumes (emptyDir,  configMap, secret, downwardAPI, CSI ephemeral volumes. Etc.,)**
As we all know, once f'ed, it's f'ed. 
processes like for eg: RAM's memory, CPU's processes and such.  

- **Persistent volumes (PV -> Static and dynamic with StorageClass)**


###### Volume types supported by K8s,
- AWS EBS CSI
- AzureDisk CSI, [[azure_disk]]
- GCE CSI
- vSphere CSI
- CephFS, rbd
- ConfigMap, secret, downwardAPI, hostPath
- iSCSI, local, NFS [[nfs-server-setup]]
- PVC
- Projected
