# 2.  Jobs auto-cleanup
Jobs auto-cleanup - [Doc]

Will use the same for what we used to create the job,
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: job1
spec:
  backoffLimit: 3
  suspend: false
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 30 #time to leave
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: job1-container
        image: alpine:latest
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "echo Hello from the job1"]
```
here, we have written:
```sh
ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 30 #time to leave
```
>which cleans up the jobs within 30secs. No manual intervention required, k8s takes care of the same `kube-controllermanager` to be specific to perform an AUTO-CLEANUP for finished jobs.

**APPY THE SAME AND VERIFY YOURSELF**

WILL LOOK THE SAME FOR `Cron` AS WELL.
