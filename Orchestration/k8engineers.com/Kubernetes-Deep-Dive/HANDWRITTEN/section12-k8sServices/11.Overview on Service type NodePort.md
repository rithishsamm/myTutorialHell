Overview on Service type NodePort - [Doc]

**Demo: Overview on Service type: `NodePort`,**

To experiment with the same, will use the same application as part of our practice. This is a simple `svc` and this deployment object is more than enough. 

Just to understand services, not the workload resources. 


`deploy.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deploy
  labels:
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0
  
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
      env: prod
      release: v1.0

  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deploy
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: write-app
        image: alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - name: deploy-shared-volume
          mountPath: /var/log

      - name: serve-app
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        volumeMounts:
          - name: deploy-shared-volume
            mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
          
      volumes:  
      - name: deploy-shared-volume
        emptyDir: {}
```
this is the `deployment` workload resource object to experiment with **ExternalIP** `svc`. Same stuff. 
>`deploy` object -- creates `rs` --> creating `3replica`  --> `PODs` with 2containers on each available node .

Will apply and verify the `deploy.yaml` first,
```sh
kubectl create -f /path/to/deploy.yaml
kubectl get deploy,po -o wide
```
app is created. back to `svc`,

So, the **NodePort** `svc`,
if we lookback to the manifest of **ClusterIP** `svc`, here it is nothing much different other than **NodePort** specific parameters,
```sh
type: NodePort
```

manifest of **NodePort**`svc`:
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-nodeportsvc
  labels:
    app: nginx-nodeportsvc
  
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
    
  # type: ClusterIP
  type: NodePort #30000-32767
```
ykwim!, that simple. just declare the `type` param and specify `svc` type.

As we saw about **NodePort**'s overview, it is primarily **NodeIP** and **NodePort** specific of the Node. So obviously the Port specification is needed. 

About the Port, the Series of Ports ranges from: 30000 - 32767
```sh
kubectl create -f /path/to/nodeportsvc.yaml
```

Since, we are doing **NodePort** `svc`, doesn't mean it creates **ClusterIP**. It creates **ClusterIP** and yes, it it possible to use the same to expose application out to the internet but additionally **NodePort**. 

what does it mean? if you verify the resource
```sh
kubectl get svc -o wide
```
verify,
```
NAME          nodeportsvc
TYPE          NodePort
CLUSTER-IP    10.98.166.208
EXTERNAL-IP   <none>
PORT(S)       80:31119/TCP
AGE           95s
SELECTOR      app=nginx-app,env=prod,release=v1.0
```

here, and the same in the manifest. The port section is
1) port is the port of the service
2) **TargetPort** is the port that the application is exposed to.

What **NodePort** means by here, in the output's port section,
`PORT(S) - 80:31119/TCP`, Picked the **NodePort**'s range by itself that the application is just got exposed to. 

**NodePort got binded to the application port.**
just do the 
```sh
curl svcIP
```
and just works as same as ClusterIP but here within the cluster but what we have been using over here is NodePort and it is supposed to work **outside cluster by accessing and opening up the Node machine's IP and Port**. 

So, to proceed with that,
```sh
ip a
```
either pick the **systems's** IP address or the **localhost**.

```sh
curl nodeMachine/VMsIP:bindedNodePort
curl 192.168.0.123:31119
```
just works! **Voila**! port80 for the `svc`. within the NodePort's range of 30000-32767. OK THIS IS INSIDE CLUSTER. HOW ABOUT EXTERNAL TRAFFIC. 

GO TO BROWSER and,
```url
nodeMachine/VMsIP:bindedNodePort
192.168.0.123:31119
```
:) out in the public to access via browser. 

If anything is conflicting in this setup, please do mind to release and expose all the essential port in the firewall.

>**WORFLOW**:
External Traffic -- PUT --> server/VM - Node --> `svc`(NodePort) --> `Deploy` -> `rs` -> `backendPODs`.

We have seen that the **NodePort** `svc` picks randomly within its range. But,

Instead of getting random port number, how do i get a specific port number within the **NodePort**'s range, so to do that
```sh
kubectl delete svc svcName
```

You can specify the port number within its range. 
```Yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nodeportsvc
  labels:
    app:  nodeportsvc

spec:
  selector: 
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 31000
      protocol: TCP
  # type: ClusterIP
  type: NodePort
```
THIS HOW ITS DONE. APPLY THE MANIFEST AND IT JUST WORKS!

```sh
kubectl create -f path/to/nodeportsvc.yaml
kubectl get svc,deploy,po -o wide
nodeMachine/VM-IP:nodeport
```

WHAT IF YOU GIVE A **NodePort** NUMBER NOT WITHIN THE RANGE? Lets day, you use a port that are available in every node *not conflicting with any other*. NOTHING BUT THROWS ERROR of,
```
The Service "nodeportsvc" is invalid: spec.ports[0].nodePort: Invalid value: 3900: provided port is not in the valid range. The range of valid ports is 30000-32767
```
Schema validation error. So, provide appropriate range within 30000-32767.
