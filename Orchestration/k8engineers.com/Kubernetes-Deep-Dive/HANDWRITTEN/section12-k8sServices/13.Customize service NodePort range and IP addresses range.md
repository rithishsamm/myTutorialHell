# 13. Customize service NodePort range and IP addresses range
Customize service NodePort range and IP addresses range - [Doc]

How else we can customize the **NodePort** `svc` and the IP range, (that we mentioned previously while referring the NodePort's Overview. Defying the laws of breaking the range beyond 30000-32767)

eg: if your admin or as per organizational demands that they are not convinced with the excuse of having the range only within 30000-32767. How to crack this.

1) Login to the **control plane** node (coz it have all its K8s Component's manifest)
2) located in
```sh
sudo ls -al /etc/kubernetes/
sudo ls -al /etc/kubernetes/manifest 
```
3) open a `kube-apiserver`component to customize,
```sh
sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
```
4) there, under the `container` section. find the parameter of `--service-node-port-range`, below that, add the parameter, (any range as per convenience)
```sh
--service-node-port-range=25000-28000
```
5) after that, cant run `kubectl` commands. since it is restarting the entire cluster to apply the changes. so wait for it.
6) to check the changes applied, 
```sh
sudo ps aux | grep kube-apiserver
```
7) here, find the flag of `--service-nodeport-range`
8) and check if the range is applied. 
9) if so, create an `svc` to conclude. 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nodeportsvc
  labels:
    app:  nodeportsvc

spec:
  selector: 
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 27000 
      protocol: TCP
  # type: ClusterIP
  type: NodePort
```
```sh
kubectl apply -f /path/to/nodeportsvc.yaml
```

if the range is out of scope/not correct, will throw
```
The Service "nodeportsvc" is invalid: spec.ports[0].nodePort: Invalid value: 39000: provided port is not in the valid range. The range of valid ports is 25000-28000
```

same goes for **ClusterIP** range by changing classes. Should not conflict with the POD or with **nodeIP** address. !IMP: DO NOT MESS WITH THESE.
