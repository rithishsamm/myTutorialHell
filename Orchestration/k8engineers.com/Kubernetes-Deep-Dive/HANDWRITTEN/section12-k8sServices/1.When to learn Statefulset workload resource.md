# Section 12: K8sServices
# 1.  When to learn Stateful set workload resource?

![[Pasted image 20250219185128.png]]

So far, we have covered `rc`, `rs`, `deploy`, `ds`, `cj`, `jobs` and in bonus `auto-cleanup`, 

What is left is, **Statefulset** `sts`

Before, diving into this `sts` Statefulset. We have to/should know the difference between **Stateful** and **Stateless** Resources and a basic understanding about **Services** and **Storage - PV and PVC**,
> K8s Component:  ==**Services**== and ==**Volumes**==
Then will be able understand,
- What is Statefulset
- Why is Statefulset
- and all the advantages of using Statefulset Application Deployment on K8s.

Nothing major but the topics of `Headless` services. Before knowing this, first we need to understand what is `service` in K8s and why + `volumeClaimTemplates` same excuse goes here. Need to understand `volumes - pv, pvc`, difference of **static** and **dynamic** volumes for `sts ` before understanding this. 

Thats why we are jumping into services and storage before diving into **K8s Workload Resource:  ==Statefulset `sts`==**
