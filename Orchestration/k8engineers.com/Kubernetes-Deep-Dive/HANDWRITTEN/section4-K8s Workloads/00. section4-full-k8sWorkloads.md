So far, we been discussed about Workloads, means POD. 
>Previously  we have touched a note that,  
>IT IS NOT A BEST PRACTICE OR PEOPLE DON'T DEPLOY APPLICATIONS ON A SIMPLY STANDALONE, were they are very prone to failures caused by any means. can occur via system error, network error or application error.
AFTER SUCH CASES? AND THINGS GET RECOVERED AND THE NODE GETS SPAWNED? Will all the pods with our application exists on our node?
**NO! create manually by passing the same to kubectl** -
==DRAWBACK OF STANDALONE PODS== ALL THINGS CONTAINERS ARE TAKEN CARE BY `kubelet` no prob. WHAT IF THE WHOLE NODE GETS BRICKED?

**Concern**: we cannot deploy critical or any applications in such a loose environment.
so Solution? There are solutions. These concerns can be satisfied with the help of a set of 
**==WORKLOAD RESOURCES==**. IS IT DIFFERENT FROM POD? **YES**!
**If standalone**: all things manual
**If with Workload Resources:** 
Way things works is different, such as Functionality, handling the PODs Lifecycle policy is all different.

Will see all of that in brief.

K8s Workload Resources Introduction:
> [!workload resources:] **WORKLOAD RESOURCES:**
> **1) ReplicationController** 
> **2) ReplicaSet**
> **3) Deployment**
> **4) CronJobs**
> **5) DaemonSet**
> **6) Statefulset**
> **7) Jobs**
> **8) (followed by Jobs) -> Auto Clean-up for finished jobs**
VERY VERY IMPORTANT SHIT THAT MANAGES YOUR RESOURCES:

###### 1) ReplicationController 
 **ReplicationController** is a basic choice that helps running multiple pods.  Replicate running identical multi-container application pods. 
In near future, the ReplicationController might get deprecated. Alternatively, ReplicaSet.

###### 2) ReplicaSet
Instead of ReplicationController, **ReplicaSet** is the go to solution for the same. **ReplicaSet** is a highly recommended to use for the same instead of ReplicationController.  Why?
ReplicaSet is used in the backend with a resource named **Deployment**.

###### 3) Deployment
 Deployment is using ReplicaSet in the backend to create and deploy replicas. 
 > WTF IS EVEN A REPLICA? -> **==Creating Multiple Pods ad handling them by `kube-controller-manager` ==**, If anything goes wrong with the pod like failure, crash, brick, failed or even deleted either intentional or unintentional. 
 
 K8s will check a parameter called `desired-state` and `actual-state` in the pod creation manifest. With that, if anything occurs getting created or deleted above or below abiding that states. 
> Deletes if more than desired number gets created or created if there is below that desired number.

THESE ARE MANAGED BY K8s. These works with the help of Replica concept in the backend. Will see more about these in brief.








###### 4) CronJobs


###### 5) DaemonSet


###### 6) Statefulset

**K8s Workload resource replication**

###### WHAT IS REPLICATION FOR K8s WORKLOAD RESOURCES?
1) **RELIABILITY**:
To ensure that we have minimum number of PODs running on the cluster for application to be accessible without downtime if any.

2) **LOAD BALANCING**:
We can add **service object** to Load Balance the traffic so that load will be generated on specific POD running on same node or different node.

3) **SCALING**:
If we need to increase or decrease the number of POD for the replicas we can do it on. FYI.
