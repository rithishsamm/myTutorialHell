DaemonSet workflow (Declarative approach) 

Will create a manifest for this `ds` to get started:

Will pick a sample app instead of images to understand the context here, all the functionalities, options available in the `ds`  in brief.  

or we can simply drop in the same template of deploy - (removing the `replica` and changing the appropriate terms and such.)
> THE ONLY MAJOR DIFFERENCE THAT WE WILL BE HAVING HERE IN OUR MANIFEST IS THE ==`taints` and `tolerations`== - this itself it's a different topic that comes under **scheduling**

By default, the Control plane don't accept to deploy PODs in that node. To make that work, have to remove the same. Taints and Tolerations.  

1) To do that, we have removed it imperatively. by doint
```sh
kubectl get no -o wide
kubectl describe no nodeName(ctrlplane) -o wide
kubectl events no nodeName(ctrlplane) -o wide
```
```sh
kubectl edit no nodeName(ctrlplane)
```
remove taints and tolerations and done! good to go for `ds`.
```yaml
  taints:
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready
```
if not done! Do it 

1) declaratively, we do in the manifest of the same:
```yaml
spec:
      tolerations:
      # these tolerations are to have the daemonset runnable on control plane nodes
      # remove them if your control plane nodes should not run pods
      - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
        operator: Exists
        effect: NoSchedule
      - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
        operator: Exists
        effect: NoSchedule
```
DEPENDS UPON THE NODE. 

If already `taints` released in the control plane node, no need to declare in the manifests. IT WORKS JUST FINE!

`ds.yaml`

            mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      volumes:  
      - name: deploy-shared-volume
        emptyDir: {}
```
++ removed taints of Control Plane,
> all the nodes will be having a POD within. 

All the essential work has been done to deploy a `ds`.

So one POD for each and every available node. 

```sh
kubectl create -f deploy,rs,po -o wide
kubectl get deploy,po -o wide
```
watch and analyze yourself without the concept of `replication`, who many PODs have been deployed on each available node. 

BEHAVIOUR: **==One POD per node==**
> Workflow: DaemonSet -> POD(`ds` itself creates the PODs).

> Use cases:  Running services for scripts, monitoring, logging, observability, more grunt work and such.
I NEED ALL THESE SERVICES ON ALL ON MY NODES FOR THE SAME FEATURES AND REASONS. FOR SUCH USECASES, `ds` is the way.

What if i add another node for instance, does it add the POD on that node on the fly - **==YES, by default==**! *Unless and until, if there are restrictions applied to it (with the `nodeSelector` and `nodeAffinity` and such)*

++ if any of the POD gets deleted by any chance, gets **recreated** automatically. try deleting one and watch it b yourself. 
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl delete po podName
```


NOW WILL COVER MORE OF `rollout` and `rollback` as same for the `ds` object.
