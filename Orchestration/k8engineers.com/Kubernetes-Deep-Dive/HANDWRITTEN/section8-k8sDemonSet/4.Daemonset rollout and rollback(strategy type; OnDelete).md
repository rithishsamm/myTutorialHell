- Daemonset rollout and rollback (strategy type OnDelete) - Doc



---
# 4.  DaemonSet rollout and rollback(strategy type: On Delete)

will cover the same Rollout, Rollback **`StrategyUpdate=OnDelete`**. Quite different from what we have seen earlier. (even than recreate)

OnDelete applies the changes first but **updates/downgrades only if we delete the PODs by ourselves**. 

To edit the `StrategyType`=`Ondelete`
Declaratively, simply apply this into the manifest:
```yaml
spec:
  strategyType: onDelete
```

Imperatively,
```sh
kubectl edit ds dsName 
```
change `StrategyType: OnDelete`

and make the changes:
```sh
kubectl set image ds dsName containerName=versionTag
```

ALL DONE. If you check the pods,
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
```
Nothing has been changed. as per the `StrategyType=OnDelete`, deletes if we delete these PODs by ourselves. 

Will delete the POD and see the changes:
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl delete po podName1 podNameN
```
when POD gets deleted, **new gets recreated BUT WITH THE UPDATED VERSION**.
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
curl -I IP
```

++We can limit the **revision history** limits. (imperatively and declaratively(under the spec of ds))
