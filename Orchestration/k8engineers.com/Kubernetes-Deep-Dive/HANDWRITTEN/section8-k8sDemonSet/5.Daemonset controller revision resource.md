# 5. Â DaemonSet controller revision resource
Will try to understand how all the **revisions** of `ds` gets  stored in all the available nodes in the K8s Cluster. 

To see the revisions,
```sh
kubectl rollout history ds/dsName
```

> Generally, these revisions of the `ds` used to get stored in an object called ==**Controller Revision**==. 
A separate resource object who will stores the `ds` DaemonSet revision information. 

Before diving deep into that,
Will do pull and identify relative PODs using **Labels**. 

To print all the available PODs with the labels:
```sh
kubectl get ds,po -o wide --show-labels 
```
if you do that,


| NAME               | READY | STATUS  | RESTARTS | AGE | IP            | NODE          | NOMINATED NODE | READINESS GATES | LABELS                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------- | -------- | --- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pod/nginx-ds-7cw54 | 2/2   | Running | 0        | 43m | 10.244.11.152 | workernode124 | <none>         | <none>          | app=nginx-ds,controller-revision-hash=c98b57755,env=prod,pod-template-generation=8,release=v1.0 |
| pod/nginx-ds-mjscm | 2/2   | Running | 0        | 43m | 10.244.55.173 | workernode124 | <none>         | <none>          | app=nginx-ds,controller-revision-hash=c98b57755,env=prod,pod-template-generation=8,release=v1.0 |
| pod/nginx-ds-z2wq7 | 2/2   | Running | 0        | 43m | 10.244.11.152 | workernode124 | <none>         | <none>          | app=nginx-ds,controller-revision-hash=c98b57755,env=prod,pod-template-generation=8,release=v1.0 |

In the labels section, shows a parameter named,
```
LABELS = pod-template-generation=n
```
This `pod-template-generation=n` indicated the number of revision it is, or it is currently using is the case.

If we perform an **upgrade or downgrade**, the revision will be added and rolled out. verify the same by performing one and check the same.
```sh
kubectl rollout history ds/dsName
kubectl get po -o wide --show-labels
curl -I IP
```

with this, the
```
LABELS = pod-template-generation=n+1
```

BACK TO THE POINT,
HOW THE INFORMATION IS GATHERED FROM A RESOURCE CALLED ==**Controller Revision**== FOR `ds`. 
will see that now, 
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide --show-labels
```

```sh
kubectl rollout history ds/dsName
kubectl get controllerrevision
```

Filter specific PODs using **Labels** calling the same by the particular **revision** number:
```sh
kubectl rollout history ds/dsName
kubectl get controllerrevision -l labelName
```
Here, there is a column named **REVISION** having the name **revision** numbers + with it's very on **hashcode**
> So this object - `controllerrevision` who controls the revision of the same. 

FROM THIS, WE GET THAT ALL THE REVISION NUMBER OF `ds` GETTING THE OBJECT'S **ROLLOUT** AND **ROLLBACK**  hAVING THE SEPERATE RESOURCE CALLED **==`controllerrevision`==**.

WHICH CAN BE SEEN ON THE PODs or using
```sh
kubectl rollout history ds/dsName
kubectl get controllerrevision
```

WHAT IF WE DELETES ONE?
if we delete one of these particular `controllerrevision`, will see that by practice:
```sh
kubectl get controllerrevision
kubectl get controllerrevision -l labelName
```
```sh
kubectl delete controllerrevision revisionName
 ```
gets deleted. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE POD?

As per StrategyType=OnDelete, having a version that is up and running but we delete the `controllerrevision` of the same. 
```sh
kubectl get ds,po -o wide --show-labels
```
and THAT PARTICULAR POD will show the hash of the POD in its label in the param `controller-revision-hash=theHashThatWeDeleted`.

NOTHING HAPPENS TO THE RUNNING POD, containing the same label from the `controllerrevision`. THE CATCH IS THAT, THERE WILL BE NO `controllerrevision` FOR THE POD. BUT WORKS!

NOTHING HAPPENS TO THE POD. 

WHAT ABOUT THE `rollout` HISTORY?
```sh
kubectl rollout history ds dsName
```
that revision gets deleted. since all these `revision` numbers gets controlled by the `controllerrevision` itself.

POD still exists and works just fine!
