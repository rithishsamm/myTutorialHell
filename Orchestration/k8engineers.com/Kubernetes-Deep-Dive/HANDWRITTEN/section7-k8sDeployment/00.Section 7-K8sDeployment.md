# 1. Introduction to Deployment(deploy)
Introduction to Deployment - [Doc]
> K8s Workloads - ==**Deployment `Deploy`**==

Will see our next as part the of the list of **Kubernetes Workload Resources:** **Deployment**. Shortcut: `Deploy` as part of the concept under **==Replication==**. 
- what is deployment
- how that falls under the concept of `replication`
- applications of `deployment`
##### K8s Workload Resources: **Deployment** `Deploy`
- `Deployment` moreover the features are similar with  `ReplicaSet` 
- In addition to that, deployment can *`rollout`* and `rollback` applications
- **Workflow**: Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> POD
- **Features**: ScaleIn and ScaleOut, Rollout and Rollback, Pause rollout/rollback, remove older `RS`
- `apiVersion` for Deployment Object is `apps/v1`
- When Deployment manages `ReplicaSet`, do not modify `pod-template-hash` label
- Rollout and Rollback can be performed though `Imperative` (the recommended approach) or Declarative Approach.
- We can check the number of rollouts done for a Deployment by executing commands such as
```sh
kubectl rollout history deploy/deploymentName

kubectl rollout undo deploy/deploymentName [--to-revision=<revision-number]
```
- Duplicate revision details (podTemplate) are not stored, for which latest revision number will be listed and old one will be removed
- `Deployment` supports two strategies: `RollingUpdate` (default) and `Recreate` (.spec.strategy.type)
-> `RollingUpdate` (default) -> Max unavailable and Max Surge
 - `Deployment`revision history limit can be set under `.spec.revisionHistoryLimit` (default: 10)

##### Deployment object has same feature that `ReplicaSet` has provided
`Deployment` object has same feature that `ReplicaSet` has provided. As we seen when we were referring to `rs` and also the `rc`. Features such as `matchLabels`, `matchExpressions` and all the operators that comes within. 
>ALL WILL BE PRESENT SAME IN THE `Deployment` object too as same with the `rs` and `rc`

##### In addition to that, deployment can *`rollout`* and *`rollback`* applications
`deploy` which is `Deployment` object can **rollout** and **rollback** your application.
eg:
- a **manifest.yaml** created for a`deployment` object.
- in this `deploy` manifest contains the **`PodTemplate`** section as same as any other. will all the essential parameters.
- In the **`PodTemplate-hash`**,  
-- how the Pods has to be created,
-- what Pods to create,
-- how many containers you want to create in that POD. 
-- all the essential details for that particular containers. 

![[Pasted image 20250206112000.png]]

> Now, this `deploy` **Deployment** object creates -> an `rs`, **ReplicaSets** means `replicas` of all these PODs be will created based on the **PodTemplate** `(!new -> + a random hash with the template)` and it is controlled by `rs`, gets deployed in all the available nodes . 

Tomorrow, if i want to **update** or **upgrade** my application means, 

###### - Rollout (update/upgrade)
eg: assume here that we have a version and want to upgrade to a higher one, 
i.e.: `nginx:v1.10` ->  `nginx:v1.11` 
> IF WE PERFORM AN UPGRADE LIKE THAT in the `deploy` object -> creates if doesn't exist, works with the `rs` is exist -> and the same (where replication of PODs gets created based on the **PodTemplate** `(+ a new hash)`in all the available nodes)
**-> `rs` will be persistent with AFTER THESE NEW RESOURCES GET DEPLOYED**(based on the new hashed PodTemplate), **OLDER PODs WILL BE CLEANED UP!**
>
So!, This random`#hash`'s which comes with the **PodTemplate**, WHAT IS THIS? 
for an Identification, to do version control for the `deploy` object and the resources that comes with it.

###### - Rollback (downgrade/restore)
since the `rs` is persistent, it reverts back to the **previous hash of the PodTemplate**. The new PODs will be removed and the older pods will be created as it was based on the template it had. 
 > **THIS `rollout` and `rollback` feature available only in the `Deployment` object**. not in standalone PODs, `rc`, and `rs`, only in `deploy`

> `deploy` UPGRADE YOUR APPLICATION AT ANY POINT OF TIME! (apart from scaleIn and scaleOut)
**-this workload object is the baseline object that are used in many of the Realtime k8s clusters.** 

##### **Workflow**: Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> POD
workflow of how the PODs get created based out of the Workload Resources: 
> `Deploy` -> creates an `rs` of that -> `rs` which have the `replica+Podtemplate` -> creates all the PODs in all the available nodes, based on the PodTemplate
	
##### **Features**: ScaleIn and ScaleOut, Rollout and Rollback, Pause rollout/rollback, remove older `RS`
Features of `deploy`:
- **scaleIn** -> scaleIn (extra++) the number of PODs and resources
- **scaleOut** -> scaleOut(decrease--) the number of PODs and resources 
- **Rollout** ->  updates and upgrades applications and all the versions can be identified with hashes 
- **Rollback** -> rollbacks, downgrades, restore back to the older versions
- **Pause rollout and rollback** -> can be paused, can halt the running rollout or rollback process  
- **remove older `rs`** -> those persistent `rs` will not be deleted by the `deploy` but we can remove the same out of the equation means clusters. 
 
##### `apiVersion` for Deployment Object is `apps/v1`
`deploy.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
```
as same as `rs`

##### When `Deployment` manages `rs`, do not modify `pod-template-hash` label
as per the design and the feature of rolling out and back in, Where the `deploy`object creates -> `rs` -> creates PODs based on `replica` + `PodTemplate-Hash`. 

THIS `#hash` is not to be messed up with. it will collapse the whole version control cycle that has been maintained by the`deploy` object. 

##### Rollout and Rollback can be performed through `Imperative` (the recommended approach) or Declarative Approach.
Rollout and Rollback can be performed through `Imperative` (the recommended approach) or Declarative Approach.
**here, `imperative` approach - which is *command line based* is recommended** than declarative. You don't want to do these more often. commanding this action up and down rarely. works.  can upgrade or downgrade my applications using commands, or can write `.yaml` too.  

##### We can check the number of rollouts done for a Deployment by executing commands such as
```sh
kubectl rollout history deploy/deploymentName

kubectl rollout undo deploy/deploymentName [--to-revision=<revision-number]
```

6) we can check the number of `rollouts` and `rollabacks` in ease using these commands. 
-> will tell you how many revisions (upgraded and downgraded your application) that you have done.
```sh
kubectl rollout history deploy/deploymentName
```

7) if u want to rollback your deployment(downgrading) , do 
```sh
kubectl rollout undo deploy/deploymentName [--to-revision=<revision-number]
```

##### Duplicate revision details (PodTemplate) are not stored, for which latest revision number will be listed and old one will be removed

Duplicate revision details (PodTemplate) are not stored in the history,
eg:
```sh
kubectl rollout history deploy/deploymentName 
```
will show you all the revision numbers. If you compare two numbers, both doesn't contains the same details. 
`(like git where no commits will contains all the details just the changes)` of the PodTemplate. **All each of these `PodTemplates` will be different.** 
for which latest revision number will be listed and old one will be removed


##### `Deployment` supports two strategies: `RollingUpdate` (default) and `Recreate` (.spec.strategy.type)
-> `RollingUpdate` (default) -> Max unavailable and Max Surge
Supports two strategies:
8) Rolling update strategy - (all Pods will get deleted and updated one by one, one at a time) default 
9) Recreate strategy - (all PODs will be deleted and created all at one time)

this will make more sense when we `rollback` and `rollout` our applications.

##### `Deployment`revision history limit can be set under `.spec.revisionHistoryLimit` (default: 10)
if,
```sh
kubectl rollout history deploy/deploymentName 
```
gives rollout history. how many details that can/should be printed. (like in linux, head print first 10, tails prints last 10 and such.) - DEFAULT IS 10. Output can be limited to print under revision history. 

> will see practicals from here.

# 2.  Deployment workflow (Declarative and Imperative)
Deployment - Imperative & Declarative approach - [Doc]

will deploy an nginx-app for the context to implement `deploy` (object) workload resources, the features, functionalities and the applications. 

Since, `rs` is more similar to `deploy` object, will follow with the same manifest taking that as a template here for the deployment. 

So, will drop the last manifest here and just do very minimal changes since, 
- **`apiVersion`** for `Deployment` is as same as `rs` = `apps/v1 `
- **`kind`** from `Replicaset` to `Deployment`
-  metadata as per convenience. 
- spec as same as `rs` + extra parameters  as per convenience. `replica` is must 
- same goes for `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`, since `Deployment` object creates/uses `rs` under  the hood, so same works here as well. Here, will just use `matchLabels` - simply to identify the PODs. 
- and the rest are obsolete. (PodTemplate, Spec of containers and the shared volume..)
> recap of the workflow: 
`Deployment` -> `rs` -> `Replica`+`PodTemplate+hash`->Pods in all the relevant nodes.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
  labels:
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0
  
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
      env: prod
      release: v1.0

  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-rs
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: write-app
        image: alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - name: rc-shared-volume
          mountPath: /var/log

      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        volumeMounts:
          - name: deploy-shared-volume
            mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      volumes:  
      - name: deploy-shared-volume
        emptyDir: {}
```

NOW, WILL SEE DEPLOYING THIS IN BOTH **IMPERATIVE** and the **DECLARATIVE** WAY. 

###### 1) Declarative way:
create and verify `deployment` workload resource,
```sh
kubectl create -f /path/to/deploy.yaml
```
```sh
kubectl get no 
kubectl get deploy -o wide 
kubectl get rs -o wide
kubectl get po -o wide
```

here, while doing `kubectl get `
10)  `no` - to check all the available nodes

11)  `deploy` - to check the status of the `Deployment` object. USUAL RITUAL.
- shows the same - desired, actual state, the app container based out of that PodTemplate, the image that it using and the selector's labels.
```sh
NAME        nginx-deploy         
READY       3/3
UP-TO-DATE  3
AVAILABLE   3 
AGE         22m
CONTAINERS  write-app,nginx       
IMAGES      alpine,nginx:latest
SELECTOR    app=nginx-app,env=prod,release=v1.0
```

12)  `rs` - reason why we are verifying `rs` while we are implementing `deployment` object. 
```sh
deployment -> rs -> replica & podTemplate+hash -> Pods
```
so, the `rs` get to exist out of `deployment` object here. 
>DEPLOYMENT CREATES AN `rs`. The name of the  `ReplicaSet` - will be having a prefix with the name of the deployment + random characters.  
 - shows the same - desired, actual state, the app container based out of that PodTemplate, the image that it using and the selector's labels.
 - in the **selector's labels,** you will see one more label named, `pod-template-hash=randomHashCode`, which is not added by us but by the `deployment` for the `rs` to identify different `replicas` among the bunch of versions. **For the `rollout` and `rollback` purposes to upgrade or downgrade your application.** 
> to handle different `rs` handles by the `deployment` object. 
```sh
NAME         nginx-deploy-7bfd94485b  
DESIRED      3
CURRENT      3
READY        3
AGE          22m
CONTAINERS   write-app,nginx  
IMAGES       alpine,nginx:latest
SELECTOR     app=nginx-app,env=prod,pod-template-hash=7bfd94485b,release=v1.0
```

1) `po` - these `pods` will get created by the result of those `rs`in the backend. 
- POD names will look like `rsName+theHashCode+randomCharacters`. since the `rs` created our PODs, so the `rs`'s names got followed here. 
> **AND EVERYTHING WILL WORK JUST PERFECTLY FINE!** 

**Here, the `data` is different but the application is as just same as others.** 

FINALLY!, understood the workflow of `deploy` -> creates -> `rs` -> uses `Replica+PodTemplatewith#hash` -> creates Pods

**Will tinker with this and get a bigger picture,**
###### 1) Deleting a Pod, (`rs`creates another Pod)
```sh
kubectl delete Po podName
```
Pod gets deleted,
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl get rs -o wide 
```
>**A new `pod` spawn and the `rs` satisfying the desired state.** 

###### 2) Deleting an `rs`
since, we know the workflow that `deployment` -> creates -> `rs` -> (takes care of Creating Pods).

What happens if we delete an `rs`,
```sh
kubectl get rs -o wide
kubectl delete rs rsName
```
```sh
kubectl get rs -o wide
kubectl get po -o wide
```
> `Deployment` object creates `rs` which eventually spins up the Pods.
- Pods will be deleted, and new one gets recreated with the new `rs`. **New Pods will be created** and 
- the new `rs` will be having/gets recreated with the same Name/ID with that suffix.  
**Benefit/advantage**: Even if i delete `rs`, it can get back to be managed in ease. 
> I don't want to delete the `deployment`, but I want to re-apply the `rs` means, simply delete `rs` which get recreated with the same old name spins new Pods (with the new changes if applied).

###### 3)  Cleanup
nothing will get cleaned up if you delete, 
- the Pods, new one gets spawned
- the `rs`, new `rs` with the same old name gets spawned
But the `deployment`, to clean up the entire resource fully means, 
```sh
kubectl delete deploy deploymentName
```
Workflow ->If `deploy` gets deleted, deletes `rs` which deletes the `Pods`.
verify the same. 
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl get rs -o wide
kubectl get deploy -o wide
```

*fin!

# 3) Deployment scale in and scale out
Demo: Deployment - Scale in & Scale out - [Doc]

`ScaleIn` and `Out` our application using `deployment` replicas,

Since `deployment` uses `rs` to enable the  **replication** feature, we can **ScaleIn** and **ScaleOut** our Pods which are created via `Deployment`.

same manifest to tinker with, `deploy.yaml`,
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deploy
  labels:
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0

spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
      env: prod
      release: v1.0

  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deploy
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: write-app
        image: alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - name: deploy-shared-volume
          mountPath: /var/log

      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
         
        volumeMounts:
          - name: deploy-shared-volume
            mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      volumes:  
      - name: deploy-shared-volume
        emptyDir: {}
```

create the object,
```sh
kubectl get deploy -o wide
kubectl get rs -o wide
kubectl get po -o wide
```
or
**!new Tip**: can combine and check resource at a time using just a `,`
```sh
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide
```

Now, since we saw the same `scaleIn` and `out` the replica count in the `rs`. THIS IS NOT WE SUPPOSED TO PERFORM SCALING, 
**Perform scaling from the `deployment` object itself,**
but same command what we have used for `rs` but here it is `deploy`, (lesser or greater to and fro)
```sh
kubectl scale --replicas=n deploy/deployName
```
scales. verify the same:
```sh
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide
```

If I want not to delete `deploy` or `rs` but all the PODs means, simply scale down the replica count to just 0
```sh
kubectl scale --replicas=0 deploy/deployName
```
to spin things (PODs) back,
```sh
kubectl scale --replicas=n deploy/deployName
```

This is all about `scaleIn` and `scaleOut`.
*fin!

# 4. Deployment  Rollout and Rollback(Strategy Type: RollingUpdate)

With the `deployment`, we have seen about the concepts of workflow, resource creation, scaling and such.

Now, will look into the most important part which highlights and stands out `Deploy` object,
==**ROLLBACK** and **ROLLOUT**==

>ROLLOUT - updating your application
>ROLLBACK - downgrading/degrading your application

same `deploy.yaml` here too
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deploy
  labels:
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0

spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
      env: prod
      release: v1.0

  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deploy
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: write-app
        image: alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - name: deploy-shared-volume
          mountPath: /var/log

      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
         
        volumeMounts:
          - name: deploy-shared-volume
            mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      volumes:  
      - name: deploy-shared-volume
        emptyDir: {}
```
apply and verify the same.
```sh
kubectl create -f /path/to/deploy.yaml
```
```sh
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide
```

Before diving into **Rolling back and out**, we have to look into things that matters for this rolling back and out concept, we have two strategy types for the same:
- RollingUpdate
- Recreate

##### RollingUpdate(default):
will see what it is, the use cases, purpose, benefits and applications. 

Why this **RollingUpdate** is the default strategy for `RollingBack` and `RollOut`?

in the `deploy.yaml`, we haven't mentioned the `strategy` anywhere in the manifest and it proceeds with the default thou. 

To check the same,
I AM CREATED THE `deploy` object
```
kubectl create -f /path/to/deploy.yaml
```
```sh
kubectl describe deploy/deployName
```
and scroll up a bit where you can see `RollingUpdate`:

```
kubectl describe deploy/deployName | grep StrategyType
```

EVEN THOUGH, WE HAVE PASSED NOTHING (strategy Type), the `RollingUpdate` has been applied by default as the **strategy Type**.

In the `RollingUpdate` strategy, we have two types/parameters,
- max unavailable
- max surge

**What is this RollingUpdate Strategy?**:
##### ROLLOUT:
whenever you deploy your application using `Deployment` object, by default, the parameter of revision goes `1`, `deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: 1` to be specific. 

THAT OBJECT WILL BE HAVING A REVISION NUMBER=1
Verify the same by passing,
```sh
kubectl rollout history deploy/deployName
```
shows output as:
```sh
deployment.apps/nginx-deploy
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE    
1               <none>
```
Revision as 1. 

Now, **What is this `revision`?**: pass the same cmd:
```
kubectl rollout history deploy/deployName --revision=1
```
SHOWS YOU a **PodTemplate**! and in that template, is the template that is up and running here. Here is `revision=1`.  

JUST LIKE CHECKING A COMMIT IN GIT TO CHECK THE STATE OF THAT COMMIT AMONG THE HISTORY OF THE APPLICATION/CODE OR PROJECT

> What if I update a rollout in the current deployment object?
-IT WILL INCREMENTALLY ADDS THE REVISION NUMBER ONE NEXT TO OTHER.

Will tinker that in practice! Lets update a spec of it and revise the same in whatever approach (either Imperative or Declarative),

BEFORE EDITING `deploy` object,
```
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide
```
check the same, UP-TO-DATE number. 

Edit an image, image's Version, resource count or any other change:
IF I EDIT SOMETHING IN THE `deployment`, IT IS AN UPDATE TO IT!, 
imperative:
```
kubectl edit deploy/deployName
```
or do a stream edit, declaratively by
```
kubectl set image deploy/deployName containerName=nginx:1.27.4(versionTag)
```
OR WHATEVER PARAMETER. shows

TO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE SAME,
```
kubectl rollout status deploy DeploymentName
```

NOW THE UPDATE WILL BE TAKEN TO CONSIDERATION AND GET APPLIED TO THE `deployment` OBJECT. 
```
deployment.apps/nginx-deploy image updated
```
**Workflow** -> changes will be applied by picking the deployment object -> the container -> param that has to be changed. 

To verify:
```
kubectl describe deploy/deploymentName
curl -I AnyPodIP
curl AnyPodIP
```

NOW CHECK,
```
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide
```
shows, the UP-TO-DATE revision number as `2`.

To see all the **revision** of the `RollingUpdate`.
```
kubectl rollout history deploy/deployName
```
shows output as:
```sh
deployment.apps/nginx-deploy
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE    
1               <none>
2               <none>
```
IF YOU DEPLOY A `deploy` OBJECT, by default adds `revision=1`. The revision number 2 here, have changes holding within itself. 

TO SEE THAT DETAILS,
```
kubectl rollout history deploy/deployName --revision=2
```
AND IT PRINTS THE DETAILS. WORKS THE SAME FOR EVERY CHANGES. 

NOW, UNDER THE HOOD. 
- THE REVISION NUMBER WILL BE UPDATED, HAVING THE UPDATE SPEC OF `PodTemplate` WITHIN
- A NEW `rs` WILL BE CREATED TO REPLACE THE OLD ONE.
- THERE WILL BE NEW POD `rs` DUE TO THE RESULT OF NEW `rs`
- AFTER NEW ONE GETS SPINNED UP, OLDER ONES GETS TERMINATED,
- HAVING THE `revision=2` UPDATED ++.
>**!MAINLY - WITH A NEW TEMPLATE#HASH**

> THIS IS `RollingUpdate`! 
-means, not all the PODs will be update at a time. Will be updated with the new changes one by one, one at a time. (with all the appropriate naming convention)

##### ROLLBACK:
 if any mess occurred with the latest rolled out update means, what we do is **Rollback**

How do we perform a **rollback**?
To see all the versions available in the first place as we saw previously, 
```sh
kubectl rollout history deploy/deployName
```
```sh
deployment.apps/nginx-deploy
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE    
1               <none>
2               <none>
3               <none>
4               <none>
```

**TO ROLLBACK:** a step behind,
```
kubectl rollout undo deploy/deployName
```
To rollback to a specific version,
```
kubectl rollout undo deploy/deployName --to-revision=n
```

TO CHECK THE CHANGE STATUS OF THE SAME,
```
kubectl rollout status deploy DeploymentName
```
might be faster, since we have the `replicaset`.

NOW, IF YOU CHECK THE **ROLLOUT** REVISIONS: EG, U ROLLED BACK TO `revision=3` means:
```
kubectl rollout history deploy/deployName
```
```sh
deployment.apps/nginx-deploy
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE    
1               <none>
2               <none>
4               <none>
5               <none>
```
THE `PODTemplate` of 3, will be deleted and it will applied here to become `revision=5`.

###### tinker:
**In this `RollingUpdate`, there are two things to it:**
- **max unavailability**
- **max surge**

Since we haven't declared in the manifest about all this `rollback`, `rollout` strategies and all. including the `StrategyType`, the type of `RollingUpdate` as `max unavailability` and `max surge`. Nothing has been mentioned over here in the manifest. THEN HOW TO PERFORM ALL THE SAME. And where we assess all this,

```sh
kubectl describe deploy/deployName
```
scroll a bit or `grep` the parameter:
>`RollingUpdateStrategy: 25% max unavailable, 25% max surge`.

Since we mentioned that, these two are only available to the `RollingUpdate` Strategy Type.

**OK! WHAT DOES THESE TWO MEANS? will understand in brief:**
###### **Deployment Strategy Type: RollingUpdate**
> 1) **max unavailability:**
	==**tldr**: how many percent of availability there has to be with the Pods should exist when there is an update or downgrade during a `RollingUpdate`==
Deployment ensures that only a certain number of Pods are down while they are being update. By default, it ensures that at least 75% of the desired number of Pods are up (default: `25% max unavailable`)

eg: will take `replica=4` evenly represents 100% of the availability. So 4Pods will be running all the time to be 100%available supervised by `Kube-ControllerManager`. 
Deployment ==Here if we are performing an **upgrade** or **downgrade** means, as per `25% max unavailable`, there will be one POD getting updated and at least 75% available, 3Podsup and running accessible for the users. getting rolled out one-by-one, one at a time. UPGRADE MUST OCCUR ONLY ONE AT A TIME.== WHICH WE CAN CHANGE TOO.

>  2) **max surge:**
	 ==**tldr**: how many new Pods that you can create. ==
> Deployment also ensures that only a certain number of Pods are created above the desired number of Pods. By default, it ensures that at most 125% of the desired number of Pods are up (`25% max surge`)

eg: same. `replica=4` representing 100%. trying to create four Pods. max surge = +25% +100% -> 125%.
 Representing 1+1 during an update/downgrade adding 25% on it. 
Deployment ==Here if we are performing an **upgrade** or **downgrade** means, as per `25% max surge`, there will be one POD getting created on top of the available resource during an upgrade/downgrade. Resource get added on top of it.== WHICH WE CAN CHANGE TOO. ==And it might resulting 125% and terminates the excess==. 

**==ULTIMATELY, EQUALIZING THE DESIRED AND ACTUAL STATE.==** **Equal balance of one gets terminated (under max unavailable), one get created (under max surge) during an upgrade or downgrade of an application in the `Deployment` Object.** 

WILL SEE HOW TO ASSESS THESE `RollingUpdate` Strategy: 
To see the spec:
```
kubectl describe deploy/deployName
```
To edit the spec:
```
kubectl edit deploy/deployName
```
scroll down a bit and change the parameter as per your convenince, here
```yaml
strategy:
 type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
   maxUnavailable: 1/25%
   maxSurge: 1/25%
```
can pass the values in count or integer or in percent. change the same to 50% or sum

CHECK AND VERIFY IF IT WORKS:
```
kubectl describe deploy/deployName
```
Make a change and check the same,
```
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide
kubectl set image deploy containerName=image:tag
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide
```
AND JUST WORKS,

IF I ROLLBACK to same (1.27.3 to latest) !, the `revision` number that I restored will be vanished since it is the same. shows like 
```
kubectl rollout history deploy/deployName
```
```
deployment.apps/nginx-deploy
REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE    
1               <none>
3               <none>
4               <none>
```


**These two strategies are only available for this `RollingUpdate`**

OKAY! SINCE WE END UP HAVING MULTIPLE VARIATION OF `rs` with having a `PodTemplate` in itself?
eg:
```sh
kubectl get rs -o wide
kubectl delete rs/rsName
```
```
kubectl get rs -o wide
kubectl rollout history deploy/deployName
```
==SINCE IT DOESNT CONTAIN ANY PODS WITHIN, GET DELETED, EVEN IT GETS REMOVED FROM THE ROLLOUT HISTORY!
CATCH IS: **WE CANNOT UNDO, AND DO A ROLLBACK**==

WHAT IF WITH ONE WITH THE PODs, As you know, gets respawned,
```
kubectl delete rs/rsNameLive
```
`rs` gets respawned with the same name but terminating the older PODs and creating new.  

WHEN TO USE THIS?
**if you want to maintenance downtime and performing continuous deployment. THIS WORKS!**


>==THIS IS ALL ABOUT `ROLLBACK` AND `ROLLOUT` OF **`RollingOut`** Deployment Strategy Type. ==

# 5. Deployment  Rollout and Rollback(Strategy Type: Recreate)

We mostly covered all the same. Same practices applies here,

**covering Recreate Strategy (a.k.a Big Bang Strategy)**
Delete everything, create everything.
simply TERMINATES and SHUTS DOWN everything all one at a time! and start spinning up the update. 
well suited for **development** environment. 

Pros: State of application will be entirely renewed. 
Cons: Downtime till it get recreated. 


same `deploy.yaml` here too
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deploy
  labels:
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0

spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
      env: prod
      release: v1.0

  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deploy
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: write-app
        image: alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - name: deploy-shared-volume
          mountPath: /var/log

      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
         
        volumeMounts:
          - name: deploy-shared-volume
            mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      volumes:  
      - name: deploy-shared-volume
        emptyDir: {}
```
apply and verify the same.
```sh
kubectl create -f /path/to/deploy.yaml
```
```sh
kubectl get deploy,rs,po -o wide
```

##### ROLLOUT: 
will do all the same with the **Recreate** Strategy. `StrategyType:Recreate`, to be specific. 

To perform the same, simply will change the parameter of the same as this - `StrategyType:Recreate`,

```
kubectl edit deploy deploymentName
```
opens an editor to modify the changes. To check the status,

TO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE SAME,
```
kubectl rollout status deploy DeploymentName
```

###### SIMPLY NOTHING BUT (as per docs)
`.spec.strategy` specifies the strategy used to replace old Pods by new ones. `.spec.strategy.type` can be "`Recreate`" or "`RollingUpdate`". "`RollingUpdate`" is the default value.

#### Recreate Deployment
> ==All existing Pods are killed before new ones are created when `.spec.strategy.type==Recreate`.==
