Introduction to Deployment - [Doc]

- K8s Workloads - Replica Set - Doc
# 1) Introduction to ReplicaSet (`rs`)

==**Deployment `Deploy`**==

Will see our next as part the of the list of **Kubernetes Workload Resources:** **Deployment**. Shortcut: `Deploy` as part of the concept under **==Replication==**. 
- what is deployment
- how that falls under the concept of `replication`
- applications of `deployment`



 
##### K8s Workload Resources: **D eployment** `Deploy`
- `Deployment` object has same feature that `ReplicaSet` has provided. 
`Deployment` moreover the features are similar with  `ReplicaSet` 
- In addition to that, deployment can *`rollout`* and `rollback` applications
- **Workflow**: Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> POD
- **Features**: ScaleIn and ScaleOut, Rollout and Rollback, Pause rollout/rollback, remove older `RS`
- `apiVersion` for Deployment Object is `apps/v1`
- When Deployment manages `ReplicaSet`, do not modify `pod-template-hash` label
- Rollout and Rollback can be peformed thorgh `Imperative` (the recommended approach) or Declarative Approach.
- We can check the number of rollouts done for a Deployment by executing commands such as
```sh
kubectl rollout history deploy/deploymentName

kubectl rollout undo deploy/deploymentName [--to-revision=<revision-number]
```
- Duplicate revision details (podTemplate) are not stored, for which latest revision number will be listed and old one will be removed
- `Deployment` supports two strategies: `RollingUpdate` (default) and `Recreate` (.spec.strategy.type)
-> `RollingUpdate` (default) -> Max unavailable and Max Surge
