# 5) Demo: RS and POD Label selector (`matchExpressions`)

Understanding **`rs` Selector's `matchExpressions`** 
-- for `rs`.

So far, we have seen about the `matchLabels` and how to write it for `rs`. Now `matchExpressions`

For `matchExpressions`, 
**There are three parameters to define.** 
- Key 
- Operator
- Values
- 
These are the three major parameter factors for defining `matchExpressions` for `rs`.
Proportional to the `PodTemplates` to label and identify PODs. 

| Key                                                                                  | Operator                                                                                                           | Values                                                                                    |

| `key_name`<br>key- just a variable like any other where you can store values within. | 1) `In`<br>2) `NotIn`<br>3) `Exist`<br>4) `DoesNotExists`,<br>these are the four operators in **matchExpressions** | `value1`<br>`value2`<br>one or more values you would like to store under a particular key |
Why these parameters and what are the logic behind this, 
-  Understanding of `key-value` pair is standard. will see how it works with the operators.

| **`In` Operator**                                                                              | **`NotIn` Operator**                                                                                                                                                                              | `Exists` Operator                                                                   | `DoesNotExists` Operator:                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - When you write/define a key, you will call in/write `In` Operator. Why?  with this           | - Opposite to `In` Operator. You defined a key and a value for it with the `NotIn` Operator.                                                                                                      | - Just a key and nothing else. Even there are values, doesn't mind                  | - Reverse of `Exist` Operator is `DoesNotExist` Operator                                                                          |
| **`Key`** + `In` Operator = can have **one or multiple `value`'s** within.                     | - `Key` + `NotIn` Operator = Key != (not equal to) value. Key should not be equal to the value. If the value is same, the `rs` doesn't launch the PODs or Such PODs cannot be controlled by `rs`. | **Key**                                                                             | No keys                                                                                                                           |
| - This operator works like `OR` condition where either one or more has to exist with that key. | - can have multiple values too. But that should not match with the Key.                                                                                                                           | - in the templateLabels, that's it!                                                 | negligible                                                                                                                        |
|                                                                                                | - This operator works like `Not equal to` condition.                                                                                                                                              | - With just a key in the PodTemplate, i can able to select the PODs managed by `rs` | - If I define any key that under that `matchExpression` Selector, that POD will not be handled by `rs`.                           |

##### Demo/Practical:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
  labels:
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0

spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
     app: nginx-app
     env: prod
     release: v1.0

  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-rs
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: write-app
        image: alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: rc-shared-volume
          mountPath: /var/log

      - name: server-app
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: rc-shared-volume
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html

      volumes:
      - name: rc-shared-volume
        emptyDir: {}
```
Will re-use the same to get more of `matchExpressions`. Previously, we have declared `matchLabels` in the `Selector` which is identically proportional to `PodTemplates` too. 

IF, DOESN'T MATCH:
```
The ReplicaSet "nginx-rs" is invalid: spec.template.metadata.labels: Invalid value: map[string]string{"app":"nginx-app", "env":"prod"}: `selector` does not match template `labels`
```
Throws this error.

and saw how to work with it! as you can see in the above given yaml file.

Now here, lets say that i don't want to work with `matchLabels` at all for some weird reason. I don't find it much feasible to work irl. WHAT ELSE WE HAVE,

> Will remove the `matchLabels`  and do `matchExpressions` instead!

Here is the simple syntax format for `matchExpressions`:

###### WILL SEE EACH OF THE `OPERATORS` AND ALSO EXPERIMENT THE SAME AS WE DID FOR, `rc`, `rs` with `matchLabels` and such. which is CHANGING THE LABELS OF THE POD MANUALLY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS!
### `In` Operator: key + `in` -> with multiple values, having any one of the value that are allowed to exist in the POD to filter by. 
```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
    - {key: app, operator: In, values: [nginx-app]}
    - {key: env, operator: In, values: [prod]}
    - {key: release, operator: In, values: [v1.0, v1.1]}
```
As you can see, ALL THE EXPRESSIONS has been declared here, using the `In` operator. 

> This `Selector` uses `matchExpressions` under `rs` with  which to identify the Pods with the help of `In` operator where,
> `app=nginx`
> `version`= is either `v1.0 `or `v1.1`
> in the `prod` environment.
>
In the `PodTemplate`, we have labeled our PODs = `v1.0`, so the rule of `selectors` selecting the `PODs` using this labels this way. PICKS THE Pods of `v1.1` version.
==**THE GETS APPLIED AND THE LABELS GET MATCHED!** ==

See that by applying the manifest creating `rs` and see it by ourselves whether it gets schema validated and works or not!

```sh
kubectl create -f path/to/manifest/rs/rs-matchExpressions.yaml
```
`rs` with `matchExpressions` got created. will check the status

```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
kubectl get rs -o wide
```
here, in `rs` under the `SELECTOR` section, the labels as
```sh
app in (nginx-app), env in (prod), release in (v1.0, v1.1) 
```
in `app` and `env` - having one values, `release` having 2values where we can able to filter out by calling any one of those values. REPRESENTING THAT PARTICULAR `SELECTOR`.

On contrast while working with matchLabels, each of those values are rigid and not very flexible to filter out since we are constrained with the working of `matchLabels`. 

meanwhile, `matchExpressions` are the representation of the `Selector` , this way of working is a different approach. 
> and the Pods and the Template itself. 

```sh
kubectl get po -o wide --show-labels
```
not bothered about the PodIP and which network they are running. **All PODs are running with the appropriate labels.** 

**++ EXPERIMENT** 

to change labels of the PODs. (either removing or updating the value of the label)
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide --show-labels
```
```sh
kubectl labels po podName labelKey=newValue --overwrite
```
**result of this: A NEW POD WILL BE CREATED TO BALANCE THE DESIRED STATE = ACTUAL STATE. and the one which WE CHANGED THE LABEL gets isolated from the `rs` running on it own.** 
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide --show-labels
```
reupdate the label back to default or any appropriate based on the options declared in `matchExpressions` and everything will be back to default and the one got newly created will get terminated, the rest will be handles by `rs`.

### `NotIn` Operator: key + `in` -> values, which should not supposed to contain / are not allowed to exist in a POD under `rs`
opposite of `In` operator:
```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
    - {key: app, operator: In, values: [nginx-app]}
    - {key: env, operator: NotIn, values: [dev]}
    - {key: env, operator: In, values: [prod]}
    - {key: release, operator: NotIn, values: [v1.1, v1.2]}
```
 `rs` will not handle and not allowed to exist. here, PODs having  keys without these values of `v1.1` or `v1.2` are good to go!

> The schema validation itself will tell you that it conflicts due to calling an illogical request. (Selector is not matching/ does not match with the template labels)
ALLOWS TO DEPLOY IF THERE ARE VALUES MISMATCHES OR NOT. 

check,
```sh
kubectl get no -o wide
kubectl get po -o wide --show-labels
kubectl get rs -o wide --show-labels
```

```sh
SELECTORS:
app in (nginx-app),env notin (dev),env in (prod),release notin (v1.1,v1.2) 
LABELS:
app=nginx-app,env=prod,release=v1.0  
```

## WHAT IF? we write both the `matchLabels` and `matchExpression` alongside in the same manifest?
Will see:
```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
      env: qa
      release: v1.0

    matchExpressions:
    - {key: app, operator: In, values: [nginx-app]}
    - {key: env, operator: NotIn, values: [dev]}
    - {key: env, operator: In, values: [prod]}
    - {key: release, operator: NotIn, values: [v1.1, v1.2]}
    
    template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-rs
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0
```

This `matchLabels`+`matchExpression` combo works as AND operation. like this + along with this also has to be passed. Then `rs` will handle **Pods**. 

CHECK AND VERIFY THE SAME WHETHER THE STATEMENT IS TRUE or FALSE.
```sh
kubectl create -f path/to/matchLabel+Expressions.yaml
```

```sh
The ReplicaSet "nginx-rs" is invalid: spec.template.metadata.labels: Invalid value: map[string]string{"app":"nginx-app", "env":"prod", "release":"v1.0"}: `selector` does not match template `labels`
```
**why because, when the rule under AND condition where both should be passed.

here, both of the values must match as same for both of these.
**TILL EACH WHICHEVER THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED HAS BEEN WORKING  WHERE ALL JUST ONE RUNNING INDIVIDUALLY. Not alongside.**

IF:
```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
      env: prod
      release: v1.0

    matchExpressions:
    - {key: app, operator: In, values: [nginx-app]}
    - {key: env, operator: NotIn, values: [dev]}
    - {key: env, operator: In, values: [prod]}
    - {key: release, operator: NotIn, values: [v1.1, v1.2]}
    
    template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-rs
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0
```
Now, 
```sh
replicaset.apps/nginx-rs created
```

### `Exist`Operator: key+`exists`= just key (like 1+0=1).

`rs-matchExpressionExistsOperator.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
  labels:
    app: nginx-app
    env: prod
    release: v1.0
  
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
      env: prod
      release: v1.0

    matchExpressions:
    - {key: app, operator: Exists}
    - {key: env, operator: Exists}
    - {key: release, operator: Exists}
    - {key: type, operator: DoesNotExist}

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: write-app
        image: alpine
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do date >> /var/log/index.html; sleep 10; done"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: rc-shared-volume
          mountPath: /var/log

      - name: server-app
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: rc-shared-volume
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html

      volumes:
      - name: rc-shared-volume
        emptyDir: {}
  ```

here, 
```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-app
      env: prod
      release: v1.0

    matchExpressions:
    - {key: app, operator: Exists}
    - {key: env, operator: Exists}
    - {key: release, operator: Exists}
    - {key: type, operator: DoesNotExist}

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-app
        env: prod
        release: v1.0
```

  **and this works, since the logic applies,  told that `type` key in doesn't exist which you don't want to exist in the manifest means, it doesn't.**
