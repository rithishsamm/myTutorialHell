# 6) How to delete RS using cascade option (demo)

as same as the rest we have seen before. 
> ***Context Recap:* THE WORKLOAD RESOURCES, NOT THE POD that are created by the `rs`.**

have the resources running or create for working out and verify, 
```sh
kubectl create -f /path/to/rsManifest.yaml
kubectl get rs -o wide
kubectl get po -o wide
```

To perform the **cascade**:
```sh
kubectl delete --cascade=orphan rs rsNameOrResourceName
```

will says
```sh
replicaset.apps "rsName" deleted
```

`rs` gets deleted, PODs? verify the same by using
```sh
kubectl get po -o wide
```
PODs exists and the application runs still, check the same by `curl` Ning the `IP`. but no `rs`.

**IF YOU CREATE THE SAME `rs`, CREATES `rs` AND THE PODS WILL BE NOT BE CREATED NEWLY AND ADDS THE OLD ONES BACK.**
