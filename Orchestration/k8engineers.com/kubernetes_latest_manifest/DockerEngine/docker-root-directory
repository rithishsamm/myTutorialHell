Some time, we need to change the docker root directory if we are running out of disk space.

lets say we have docker data present by default under /var/lib/docker and now we need to change the path since the disk is full (new path: /backup/docker)

1)Take backup of the current directory using

tar -zcvf docker-backup-$(date +%s).tar.gz /var/lib/docker

2)Now stop the docker service (Ubuntu 16.04/18.04 later)

systemctl stop docker

3)Create a directory "/backup" to set a new path

mkdir /backup

4)copy the directory to new location from /var/lib/docker to /backup

rsync -avzh /var/lib/docker /backup

5)lets update systemd with new location

vi /lib/systemd/system/docker-service

under [Service], do not remove any options on that line just add below option

ExecStart= ***** -g /backup/docker *******

save and exit


or

Above changes will effect for linux systems, if you want to apply new location changes for platform independent systems

open/create file "/etc/docker/daemon.json" and add below line


{
	"data-root": "/backup-docker",
	...
	...
}

save and exit. Now restart docker service, no need to reload systemd service.

6)Now reload systemd and start docker

systemctl daemon-reload

systemctl start docker

7)verify the changes using docker info command and by creating new container to see if that container details are stored under /backup/docker/containers or we can check with ps aux command to see if docker process is running wth new option we have passed "-g /backup/docker"
