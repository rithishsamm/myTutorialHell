check cluster dns and cluster domain

kube-dns
The kube-dns service prior to Kubernetes 1.11 is made up of three containers running in a kube-dns pod in the kube-system namespace. The three containers are:

kube-dns: a container that runs SkyDNS, which performs DNS query resolution
dnsmasq: a popular lightweight DNS resolver and cache that caches the responses from SkyDNS
sidecar: a sidecar container that handles metrics reporting and responds to health checks for the service
Security vulnerabilities in Dnsmasq, and scaling performance issues with SkyDNS led to the creation of a replacement system, CoreDNS.


In addition to addressing performance- and security-related issues, CoreDNS fixes some other minor bugs and adds some new features:

Some issues with incompatibilities between using stubDomains and external services have been fixed
CoreDNS can enhance DNS-based round-robin load balancing by randomizing the order in which it returns certain records
A feature called autopath can improve DNS response times when resolving external hostnames, by being smarter about iterating through each of the search domain suffixes listed in resolv.conf
With kube-dns 10.32.0.125.namespace.pod.cluster.local would always resolve to 10.32.0.125, even if the pod doesn’t actually exist. CoreDNS has a “pods verified” mode that will only resolve successfully if a pod exists with the right IP and in the right namespace.
