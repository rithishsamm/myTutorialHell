You add a taint to a node using kubectl taint. For example,

taints will be applied to nodes and tolerations will be mentioned in POD yaml to match taint to scedule the POD


types of effects:

NoSchedule
PreferNoSchedule
NoExecute

Syntax:

kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoExecute
kubectl taint nodes node1 key2=value2:NoSchedule

places a taint on node node1. The taint has key key, value value, and taint
effect NoSchedule. This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node1
unless it has a matching toleration.

There are some built-in taints for the nodes, where kubernetes will apply while depolying the cluster

++
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready: Node is not ready. This corresponds to the NodeCondition Ready being “False”.
node.kubernetes.io/unreachable: Node is unreachable from the node controller. This corresponds to the NodeCondition Ready being “Unknown”.
node.kubernetes.io/out-of-disk: Node becomes out of disk.
node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure: Node has memory pressure.
node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure: Node has disk pressure.
node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable: Node’s network is unavailable.
node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable: Node is unschedulable.
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized: When the kubelet is started with “external” cloud provider, this taint is set on a node to mark it as unusable. After a controller from the cloud-controller-manager initializes this node, the kubelet removes this taint.
++

To remove the taint added by the command above, you can run:

kubectl taint nodes node1 key:NoSchedule-

In-order to launch POD with the matched taint:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tolerations:
  - key: "example-key"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"


NoExecute example

++
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 3600
