**DESCRIPTION:**
In this dec, we will learn the fundamentals of SSH along with some basic DevOps and Linux stuff. We will start with a local Ubuntu server on my network and then create a remote Digital Ocean Droplet to work with. We will create sets of SSH keys for those as well as Github. We will even do a simple React app deployment.

Just a quick note, the purpose if this video is to get you familiar with ssh and servers. It is not a deployment guide or anything like that. I just wanted to cover the basics and just throw a few extra things in like the react app, apache, etc. in real life you would use virtual hosts and do some other things.

**Basics and the fundamentals on How to use it!**
**WHAT IS SSH?**
- Secure shell
- Communication Protocol (http,https, ftp and more)
- do remote
- encrypted traffic
- mostly in cli

SSH, a protocol that helps us communicate with other computers.  

###### Client Server Communication
ssh -> Client, sshd -> Server (openSSH Daemon)
The host server mush sshd installed, running and configured to allow the traffic properly or else you'll not be able to use it. which it auth with username password with few encryption standards.
