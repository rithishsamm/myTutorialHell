Linux (revision) https://youtu.be/iwolPf6kN-k?si=xcpjzjG-TKfc0MCR

This video is an introduction to Linux & Terminal commands to get you started with various command-line tools with a hands-on approach. Including concepts about bash files, environment variables, and more. Learn how to use the shell to navigate your file systems, perform various operations, work with networks, etc. We also cover some Terminal tips and best practices. An essential skill to have when working as a developer or in the field of DevOps.

##### Intro
we are looking at an introduction to linux commands. you see how these commands work and focused on like some basic commands as
well and some commands that will help you out inthe DevOps Area too.
##### About the lecture
it's more on the practical side of of things like the application based stuff right so there are two things 
1) how to use the terminal and
2) working with like the modifications of terminals and stuff
3)  writing your own terminal programs and things like that
4) shell scripting like bash scripting
5) linux infrastructure file structure how it works and whatever those things are like not required right now they will be required
6) and more
##### Terminal Emulator
usual difference between gui and cli
terminal - ability to access terminal in a graphical way
emulator - app that emulate the cli like a program
##### What is Shell
SHELL? - is a command line interface that will take all my commands as input. how does my os know that what am i saying to which application. takes input and interpret as we instruct to an executable program/ file/script and much.
explained contexts like:
-- terminal
--current directory
--shell
--shell customization(ohmyzsh and more)
--exec program
--some basic linux terminologies.
>terminal's backstage
##### List commands
cmds explained:
~~ls - list~~

~~flags~~
~~-- -1  - ls one by one~~
~~-- -a - all including hidden files~~
~~-- l - long (including permissions, file size, author, date. Simlink and more)~~
~~-- -r - reverse~~
~~-- -R - recursive~~
~~and so on.~~
~~-- -h - help for more context of each of these command~~

find: (/usr/bin/ - binary files directory)
> where program/exec/file/shell or anything

##### ls 
ls - list

flags
-- -1  - ls one by one
-- -a - all including hidden files
-- l - long (including permissions, file size, author, date. Simlink and more)
-- -r - reverse
-- -R - recursive
and so on.
-- -h - help for more context of each of these command

~ home directory
##### mkdir 
mkdir - make directories

create directories (a.k.a folders)
##### cd
cd - change directory (entering into the folder)
cd .. - one folder back
cd  ~ - back to home directory
cd /dir/ - straight to directory
##### environment variables
env var - environment variables
instead of calling a program to run it back from getting into the folder, just use the enVar to run it on behalf of that binary file. 
=> these variables are identified that programs that lies in /usr/bin/ & they get executed from /usr/bin/local/ python3 - all the binaries. you can check and verify that using "**which**" cmd.
-> which are programmable too to run stuff over the command line.

We can even set and declare environmental variables of our own. the variables can be effect or affect the environment, as the name suggests.

> named **values** that are used to **change how the you know commands and like processes**
**and everything are executed**

**Environment variables** that affects the environment, named values such as variables that **are used to change HOW A CMD OR PROCESSES ARE EXECUTED.**
Process? - an instance of a running command are known as process

objective: lets say that hoping into programs/binary files in between to get into that shell.

##### Path Environment variable
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE specified to get executed using **$** SYMBOL, 
eg: 
1) $SHELL - executes shell, 
> to show what shell is in action 
> ```
> echo $SHELL - says the current shell 
> which $SHELL - says where the binary files of the shell
> ```

another one is,
2) one of the environment variable known as $PATH
echo $PATH -> each and every executables and binaries Directories will be shown (files and folder's PATH) 
> idea is: Each and every executable files that we work with, will that exist over here (checks all the path, and executes.)

>THIS IS HOW THE COMPUTER FINDS THE EXECUTABLES AND THE COMMANDS THAT WE RUN. IF ANYTHING THAT DOESNT EXIST ON ANY OF THE FOLDER, SAYS "COMMAND NOT FOUND".

where echo -> built-in cmd.
/bin/echo
> [!nOTE] ONE OF THE MAIN USECASE
> sometimes you want to may store stuff  in your development environment like uhyou want to store **some files** or not files but  **passwords, secrets** that **you don't want to hard code in your source code**. so for that you also use environment variables.
##### Bash files + zprofile
are the SHELL / Terminal accessor that modifies the SHELL's Preprocessor. + scripting it to be as per our convenience and program it be run as a shell scripts.

kunal's explainaination: bash scripting  for example when the terminal is loaded,
1) how do i know that this color is needs to be set and this theme is needs to be set
2) all the commands and everything that it's running which shell, 
3) here we use zsh, how does my terminal know to do that whenever you open a terminal like this, **few commands are executed few files are executed automatically**
4) -- these are all dependent on bash
5) e.g.: if you're using the the the shell like the the bash cell so you have the .bashfile, .bash-profile/ .bash_profile and .bashrc file.
- in the hidden files. any files that are not shown known as hidden files which can be seen using ls -a flag. 
- cat and nano all the .bash and executables and play with all the environmental variables.
- usecase: themes, shell customization, scripting, Process management and more.

++ same goes with z-profile if we use zsh - zshell.
cat /etc/zprofle
~/.zprofile
=> this basically has the original path variables and everything are set up over here so these are like system wide over here. if you want to have your own user specific you can change the etc/.zprofile file so these are just bash

>these are just files where you put all these path variables
##### Command interpretation (Aliases)
Aliases are nothing but Shortcuts + also used for declaring custom names for commands on our own.
##### How and Where Environment Variable stored
Question: setting environment variables and all these other things, 
1) how do we actually do that 
2) where are these environment variables being saved
>all the above mentioned hidden files such as .bash_profile, .bashrc, and more. whiere these are like Subshell of the System. 
>Does all the work on behalf of an ops that maintain such use cases that fulfills the purpose as we use as environment variables.

if you want to add custom path, you can edit it all in nano, $PATH=declare path/dir and export the PATH. YOU CAN CALL MULTIPLE EXECS OVER DIFFERENT PATH TO INTEGRATE DIFFERENT EXECS.

setup custom path, MY_PATH="value" and set binary location to such path.
##### pwd 
pwd - print working directory or present working directory..
shows where/whcih directory that we are located..
##### ls
ls - list
ls - flags(tags, args): such as - for all, -h for help, -l for long, -1 onebyone and more
> => you can combine  
##### cd
. - current directory, .. - double directory
cd whatever
cd . to get back
##### ls -R
ls -R
shows all the files and folder all in the subdirectories. Recursive - folder inside a folder inside a folder. -> LS -R
##### cat
cat - concatenate - shows all the contents of a file, out in a standard output
e.g.: cat filename - shows all
+- opens , create file.. write something -  files gets created ctrl+ c done!
+- cat file.txt - pops a txt file. rest goes with all the other extensions too - such as .sh and more

cat file1.txt file2.txt -> prints output one by one
//to merge contents 
cat file1.txt file2.txt **>** file3
cat merges content of file1+2 -> file3
##### man
man - manual of a program, for reference, --help, documentation and more
##### tr
tr - translate or delete characters

e.g: cat - file1.txt - Hello World
to translate this file characters - cat file1.txt | tr a-z A-Z > upper.txt
cat file1 -> HELLO WORLD
structure: cat file1.txt (picks file) -> translate small Letters to Cap Letters > and print it in a file named "upper.txt." 
> | > - means pipe (does redirection)
##### mkdir
mkdir - make directory, mkdir /dir/ - creates folde on such custom directory

mkdir recursive one at a time works too!
##### touch
touch - creates file, should create files with the extension to declare that file format.
touch filename
touch /dir/filename - creates file 
##### cp
cp - copy files
e.g: cp file1.txt file1cp.txt
##### mv
mv - moves copied files
same as mv
eg: mv file.txt dir/
moved

mv file.txt newName.txt -> Replaced and renamed it 
echo I am in file.txt > file.txt
cat file.txt -> says i am in file.txt

mv file.txt ../dir/newfile.txt
##### rm
rm - removes a file
rm filename -> removes file, 
rm name1.txt name2.txt //rename
##### cp -R
cp -R, copies directories recursively. 
cp -R dir1 dir2
-> copies folders recursively
##### Renaming a file 
to rename, cmd - 
rm oldname newname
mv oldname newname
##### Deleting a directory
rm -R dir - deletes folder
rm -rf -> remove recursively and forcefully
##### sudo
sudo - super user do - > gives administrative privileges
sudo whatever
##### df
df - displays free disk space -  shows disk file size and the usage 
df -  shows Filesystem, 1K-blocks,Used,  Available, Use%, Mounted on
df - m -> shows in mb's 

##### du
du - estimate file space usage
	du -l - len, -h - human Readable
##### head
head - lists first few lines of code
head filename - > shows first few lines
head -n 4 (lists number of lines)
##### tail
tail - prints content continuedly in a human readable/ scrollable format, + you can throws or line to print on the terminal

same as head
##### diff
diff - compare files line by line
diff file1.txt file2.txt - compares contents line by line, and outputs the line that doesn't match
why? - often times we make some alterations and without rewriting the entire source code we need to see like what are the differences made between two files. Use diff command for that.
##### locate
locate - locates files
 locate "*.txt"  - Shows all the .txt files
 
##### find
find - walk/search for files in a directory hierarchy
just write let's say simple stuff find in current directory all the things mentioned in the current directory you have found.

find .
find .. /or whatever directory (shows all the files including hidden)

find . -type d -> find in the current folder, type is directory, f for files
find . -type f -name "file.txt" (or file*) -> shows relevant results that matches the string
find . -perm 777

find . -size +1k -> shows based on file size
find . type f -name "*.txt"  -> shows all with the format, but case sensitive
find . type f -iname "*.txt" -> not case sensitive
-mmin + - -> modified minutes ago 
-mtime -days
-mdate
man find for more info
##### File permissions and Changing it
permissions are of three types - Read, Write and Execute -> rwx
Permissions for who? - root, user, group/global

check users -> whoami

permission cmds: 
chmod - modifies or changes the file permissions, 
chown - change ownership of a file or data, 
chgrp - change group permissions //will follow along covering the same in brief

ls -l file -> shows in length and the permission

permission in values: ugo, rwx
chmod u=rwx, g=rx, o=r file.txt // u= user, g=group,o = others, rwx - read, write, exec
permission in octals based on binaries: 
chmod 777 files - rwx for all
##### chown
chown - change ownership of a file or data, 
e.g: lets change a file's permission for root
file.txt - -rwx---x--rx-
-> to change permissions;
chown root file.txt
-> not permitted
sudo chown root file.txt
ls -a file.txt -> 

cat file.txt -> permission denied
sudo cat file.txt -> done

you can find the same based to the context of permissions:
find . -perm 777
##### Performing an action on multiple files
if you find few files, filtered out in certain use case and you wanna perform action with the filtered out or contained file under a certain method or action. To perform an action on multiple files:
multiple file context + exec + action command.
e.g:
1) find . -type f -name"* .txt"
-> shows all the .txt files on that directory
-> you wanna perform an actions to that file, you can achieve doing the same with the help of -exec  and command and something known as PLACEHOLDERS when you can contained the holding values to perform an action. 
find . type f -name "* .txt"  -**exec** rm -rf {} +

-exec is the placeholder to perform and action overlapping the command on a specific constrain + {} like a container containing the contained values that we got on find cmd putting it here. ++ means recursive adding files one by one.
##### grep
grep -  grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines that match patterns
> grep - Global Regular Expression Print - allows us to search for some text. 
grep -V - check version what grep
 
searches contents (important&&useful) + like CTRK + F working with text files and such.

for grep, need some text files.
touch names.txt
```

```
touch txts.txt
touch companies.txt
```companiestxt
community
classroom 
datree
teleport
lens
google
amazon
battlesnake
twilio
elastic
```
for our rough example working with grep..
We want to search something in files, 
eg: 
$ grep "Rithish" names.txt
Rithish Sam

$ grep -w "Rithish" names.txt //**-w full name**
Rithish Sam

$ grep -w "rithish" names.txt -  **no output due to case sensitive**

$ grep -i "rithish" names.txt - **case sensitive**

flags:
-w - word
-i - case sensitive
-n - line number
-B num "name" - shows the line before given number
-r - recursively - works well with directories
./* .txt - if udk but search all the text
-l . - what files contains these matches
-c .- counts
-P "regex" - shows regex
##### history
shows history of commands that has been used in a session

history
history | grep "ls" - shows history of ls cmds
##### regex
regex - regular expressions
-G, --basic-regexp - PATTERNS are basic regular expressions
-P, -p --perl-regexp - PATTERNS are Perl regular expressions
grep -P "regex" filename
##### regex commands
regex cmds - regular expressions commands
##### alias command
alias - command on behalf.  

Aliasing - usual command to custom command

where are al these aliasing available.
cat ~./zprofile
cat ~./bashrc or bash_profile

SET ALIASES
alias gpom="git push origin main"
and more

##### Best Practices
to command with a following command in a single action 
	cmd | another cmd
	cmd \
	> another cmd \
	> another cmd or attr and more
##### Terminal shortcuts
1) alt + backspace - deletes cmd's attributes word by word instead of letter by letter
2) half bake cmd + Tab - autocompletes cmds, or shows possible existing cmds
3) ctrl + - zoom in , ctrl - zoom out
4) ctrl + a or Home -> goes to first line
5) ctrl + e - for end
6) ctrl + k - delete behind - like ctrl + del
7) up and down for before and after of cmds in history
8) history -> !cmdID -> runs cmd
9) !find or !whatever cmd -> runs last ran cmd of such cmd
10) ctrl + r -> search cmds
11) ctrl + l or k -> clear
12) ; -> helps running multiple cmds in a single line
13) sort -r file.txt -> prints content in reverse/descending in alphabetical order
14) sort file.txt -> prints in alphabetical order
15) sort -n file..txt -> in numerical order 
16) sort -f file -> not case sensitive sorting
17) jobs - running jobs - Jobs? - the processes that was initiated by the SHELL
18) ping - pings 

##### wget
Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.package installer / manager/downloader
19) wget - download files from the internet using wget
20) wget url - media/document/pdf files 
wget -o rename url
##### package manager
1) wget
2) yum
3) brew
4) apt-get
5) snap
6) rpm
##### top
top - displays Linux processes, task manager but in lightweight manner
-- in order to find like what all processes that are running and how many cpu usage they are consuming, you can see all of these processes, running jobs and more

shows: Tasks in total, in running, in sleeping, in stopped, in zombie. %CPU(s) and more.
PID - ProcessID , port number, memory and more

KILL PID - to kill process
##### uname
uname - print system information

uname -> Linux
uname -o -> says the kernel
uname -m -> says the architecture
uname -r -> kernel
-a - all,  and more
find more useful system info -> uname
##### zip
zip -  Archiver for .zip files, making compressed files and folders
cmd:
zip zipName.zip files.txt -> files get compressed to zip format
zip zipName.zip file1.txt file2.txt -> zipping in multiples
##### unzip
unzip - De-archiver for .zip files
same as zip
unzip zipName.zip 
##### hostname
 hostname - show or set the system's host name
 hostname -> rithishsamm (who's domain that current machine is running)
 hostname -i -> IP
 hostname -h -> for more info and play with many flags
##### useradd
useradd - adds user
useradd username1 -> adds user
passwd username1 -> adds password for username
##### userdel
userdel - deletes user 
userdel username1 -> deletes username1

##### Operating system commands
these are os level, operating system's built-in commands:

##### Operating system information 
cat /etc/os-release -> shows all the information about the Operating System
+
neofetch 
##### lscpu
lscpu - list CPU information -    display information about the CPU architecture
##### free
free - shows free available memory in both disk and swap
free -> metrics like  total, used, free, shared, buff/cache, available in both core and swap memory. 
##### vmstat
vmstat - virtual memory status - Report virtual memory statistics
vmstat -> information about processes, memory,  swap,  io,  system, cpu and more
##### id
id - print real and effective user and group IDs
id username-> shows my place in the environment
id group -> group in the env
##### getent
getent - get entries from Name Service Switch libraries
##### id User
Print user and group information for each specified USER, or (when USER omitted) for the current user.
##### lsof 
lsof - list open files
lsof -u username -> filters the open file assessed by users.
##### Networking commands
1) **nslookup** - query Internet name servers interactively
-> nslookup url -> shows info
-> nslookup IP -> shows the info as same as before
2)  **netstat** - part system fo net-tools - NET-3 networking toolkit
-> prints all the ports that are currently up and listening
3) **ifconfig** - shows all the network interfaces
4) **sed** -> stream editor for filtering and transforming text - changes contents on the go
-> works well logs, will see that in brief
5) telnet - 
6) nc - 
7) ssh - 
##### cut
cut - remove sections from each line of a particular file
cut -c 1-2 file1.txt -> selects 1 to 2 word in the file column wise
-> comes in handy, works well in filtering and managing logs
##### htop
htop - interactive process viewer
task manager for CLI
##### ps aux 
ps -  report a snapshot of the current processes.
ps aux -  report a snapshot of the auxiliary processes.

as same as htop with PID
##### Working with operators (running multiple commands simultaneously)
WORKING WITH OPERATORS / COMBINES VARIOUS COMMANDS
like -> you can add on extra arguments and flags along with it.
e.g.: sudo apt update && upgrade -y -> updates and upgrade with a YES over a single commands.

ping url & ping url

CHILD PROCESS CREATION - is that open up terminal and run processes where others can run.
KILL PIDs -> kills processes

Operators in commands:
**&AND Operator:**
echo rithish **&&** echo sam
**||OR Operator:**
echo rithish **||** echo sam -> if one executes, skips rest
**Pipe |** -> executes passed first command and the second command
 **~NOT Operator:** not is a negation (exceptions)
 rm -rf !(filenameForException.format)

##### run whatever if cmd executes successfully ({} - combination operator)
echo hey && {echo "hi"; echo "run whatever has to run after the executed cmd"}

##### Outro
all good!
