#### NOTES:

##### Jenkins Tutorial Overview
Will do 
1) Installations
2) Practical's
3) create build jobs
4) create build and design pipelines
5) Back to Jobs and parameterize the build jobs
6) Back to Pipelines and play with environmental variables
7) CI/CD Builds from the SCMs and do code routines for continuous integration and deployment.
8) Compile that code with build test tools like maven, SonarQube and more
9) Tests with Gradle or other tools
10) use static analysis codes to make sure all the QA, QC checks to get quality code
11) Auto pull source codes from wherever for our own apps and microservices
12) take that app or microservice, compile it, package it, put it in an executable jar file
13) create a docker image out of it
14) even push that docker image into the cloud
15) get it hosted up there on docker Hub
16) really truly create a continuous integration continuous delivery Pipeline with Jenkins
##### Prerequisites:
Install
1) Java jre jdk
2) Jenkins
3) login with credentials given
4) Install Suggested Plugins
5) yet more essentials
#### Your First Jenkins Build Job:
-- create your first Jenkins build job
just a simple hello world Jenkins build job + Jenkins hello world pipeline

Jenkins -> New Item -> name - first Jenkins -> build job, a freestyle project -> OK
Contents:
1) some standard stuff like, *discard builds* after they're done,
> note: Jenkins at its hard as a continuous integration tool continuous integration means getting code that's checked into a repository pulling it out compiling it running tests make sure that it all works. so one of the important things you can configure here

is a source code management tool
2) more source code management tools and integration
3) parameterizing a build job - steroid actions
4) Throttle Builds - Force and accelerate builds
5) and more configuration of the subsidies of plugins
6) and more
##### Jenkins Build Triggers:
going to look at the build triggers now,
What is this triggers? - 
1) when should these Jenkins build jobs be triggered, after builds, 
2) should they be triggered every day, night (Build Periodically, based on Cron Jobs Cron job syntax of minute hour day month day of week or anytime), 
3) every time somebody checks some code into GitHub,  GitHub hook trigger that will fire off the Jenkins build job anytime somebody checks some code into a particular Branch maybe the development Branch maybe the master Branch, 
4) (Poll SCM)  Jenkins can keeps on querying on check GitHub or GitLab or whatever source code management tool you're using then check to see if there's been a new commit and if there has it'll run the build job if not well.just leave things alone. 
5) + more plugin triggers.
##### Build Environments:
Custom Programmatic operational and actionable environments like,'
1) can set up secret files credential files inside ENV VAR,
2) terminate a build if it's stocked right sometimes you'll might have a hard time connecting to a network resource and your build might might hang for a little while so you can have it terminated.
3) Managing secret text or files for special critical purposes
4) Run inspection on those builds of its logs and published build scans
5) and more
##### Build Steps:
1) Add a new template to all docker clouds
2) Build / Publish Docker Image
3) Docker Compose Build Step
4) *Execute Windows batch command*
5) Execute shell
6) Invoke Ant
7) Invoke Gradle script //commonly used
8) Invoke top-level Maven targets //commonly used
9) Run with timeout
10) Set build status to "pending" on GitHub commit
11) Start/Stop Docker Containers
options and the name speaks for itself.

Add Build Step -> 
right now is adding some build steps to this Jenkins build job which is going to run periodically according to Cron. one of the options is to execute a Windows batch
command if Windows, Shell if Linux.  
> if there's something that you want to use that's not there just install a plug-in and it'll magically appear

I'm going to do a little Windows batch file magic and I'm just going to Echo you know hello world from my Jenkins build job from my first Jenkins build job.
> Windows Batch Build Step
> Write script -> echo "Hello World by Jenkins Build" 

Apply and Save.

-> Wizard -> Build Now -> Pops a build status with a green checkmark -> Click
-> (Shows info about the build) -> Console output -> (Shows Output).

and there you go hello world from my Jenkins build job and that's how easy it is to create your first Jenkins build job and run it and see the output of it.

Back to Dashboard, Shows the list of Jobs -> you can see there haven't been any problems lately so the sun is shining on -> the last time it ran was 44 seconds ago.

> [!NOTE] Conclusion
> everything was good and there you go that's how easy it is to create your very first Jenkins build job 
#### First Jenkins Pipeline:
-- create your first Jenkins Pipeline
the exact same thing but do it differently, Create a Jenkins pipeline

Jenkins -> New Item -> Name -> Pipeline -> Ok -> 
>going to print out hello world just like we did in the build job -> like to play with some environment variables so there the environment variables that are available  
>-> Pipeline -> OK

Mostly similar to the Freestyle Project -> cause, Basic config, Discard old Builds, Triggers, as same as the Build and Freestyle Project..
Description -> Build Jobs -> Triggers -> Pipeline Script IDE Section (write on groovy, Jenkins and more)

There will be Sample -> Hello world script for example -> cont.
##### A Declarative Pipeline
there's a something called a declarative pipeline (not a lot of code presented in the pipeline) also there's something called a scripted pipeline.
> There are pipelines that are to be scripted as per custom instructions. 
>Such cases are effective but unmanageable overtime.

WE'RE STICKING TO DECLARATIVE PIPELINE.
(if any complex code needed further, will use shared library to get things integrated within the scripts)
```Groovy
pipeline { //Default Declarative Pipeline, if anything complex needed, use shared library
    agent any //can run anywhere, on different env(Eg: gpu)

    stages { //stage to run steps, one stage
        stage('Hello') { //stage name
            steps {
                echo 'Hello by admin!'
            }
        }
        stage('Environment') { //environemnt stage is to place ENV variables
            steps {
                echo env.BUILD_ID
                echo env.JOB_NAME
                echo env.JENKINS_HOME
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Apply and Save.
-> Redirects you to Pipeline's Home Wizard
-> Build Now
-> Show Build Contents - The Stage's Info
-> Logs -> For Output
-> For more details -> Check Build History (green checkbox spawned on the left under Build history)
-> Click and Console Output -> For more info.
> GUI's are great, but hard to navigate and integrate.

For that, Home -> Click a job or pipeline -> Configure -> Back to edit pipeline.

#### Jenkins Environmental Variables
###### +ADDING AN OTHER STAGE + ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.
Copy Previous stage's Syntax,
    stages { 
        stage('Hello') { 
            steps {
                echo 'Hello by admin!'

EDIT THE STAGE: Declare Stage, name the stage, Put context.

**Will echo some Environment VARIABLES.**
refer docs of env-vars. (exist in *localhost(:8080/env-vars.html*))
=> Refer variables and it grows when you add more plugins eventually.
(e.g.: GIT's variables if you integrate git plugin). Can use all the environment variables :)

> Ctrl + Space -> Shows all the available local env. Variables in a dropdown. not just VARIABLES but OBJECTS (like keywords, snippets, classes, packages and components according to the programming languages that you can code with such as kotlin, groovy and such).
```
	stages { 
        stage('Environments') { 
            steps {
                echo env.BUILD_ID
                echo env.JOB_NAME
                echo env.JENKINS_HOME 
//when jenkins runs jobs, fetches data by pulling it all from GIT, puts it here in JENKINS_HOME
```

OVERVIEW: 
``` Groovy
pipeline { //Default Declarative Pipeline Description, if anything complex means, use shared library
    agent any //can run anywhere

    stages { //stage to run steps
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello by admin!'
            }
        }
        stage('Environment') { //environemnt stage is to place ENV variables
            steps {
                echo env.BUILD_ID
                echo env.JOB_NAME
                echo env.JENKINS_HOME
            }
        }
    }
}
```
//here, we have a pipeline, 2stages one is Home, one is Environment for Environment Variables to pull it off and does some actionable functions.

Apply & Save -> Build Now -> Adds and new stage in the pipeline and the build history. (Check logs and check all the environmental variables in brief) -> Check Logs in the builds -> Refer each env var

or check the Jenkins Environment Variable of Jenkins home (shows all the build job happened on the Jenkins -> Copy and Open Directory of the Jenkins Home -> Workspace such as for (Plugins, Secrets, Nodes, Logs and Jobs)-> Explore all the rolled out plugins. 

>also, you can find all the security components which can be all turn on and off.

That more of the Jenkins Pipeline, cover well not just Jenkins pipelines but also writing some cool code that takes advantage of Jenkins environment variables.
#### Parameterized Jenkins Build Jobs

PARAMETERIZING -> parameterizing a build job where we can handle environment variables + pass in parameters as well.

IDEA BEHIND PARAMETERIZED BUILD JOB:
e.g. An example Jenkins build job for pass in to print the version of Java. (a simple command of JAVA_VERSION)
(for that, you have to precheck or reconfigure JAVA JDK lies on bin directory on the $PATH) && Also turning it off too.

**Objective1**: print the version of the JDK installed also Turning it off too.
+SUCH CASES OF PARAMTERIZING DOESNT APPLY ONLY FOR JOBS BUT FOR ALSO **PIPELINES**. (Important for DevOps = Parameterized Jenkins Pipeline).

Jenkins -> New Item -> Name and Select Freestyle Project -> Ok
Home -> Click The Project is parameterized -> Click Check Box -> Add parameters ->
(different parameter that Jenkins provides such as Boolean, Choice, Credentials, File, Multiline String, Password, Run, String)
-> Choice Parameter here sake -> Input Name  (shallIPrintTheVersion) , Choices (Yes, /n No) , Description -> Add a build step -> Run a batch command -> write script 
```bat
if "%shallIPrintTheVersion" == "Yes" (
 java -version
)
if "%shallIPrintTheVersion" == "No" (
 echo "Okay :) No version Printed out! "
)
```
// now created a build step based on logic following with the parameter asking a yes or no question.
Apply and Save.

**EXECUTION**:
Back to wizard -> Build with Parameters -> Ask for a Parameter (Yes or No) -> Build -> Build gets done successfully -> Check Console Output for detailed output.
> Same params applies for Pipelines too! (Up and running Pipeline)

Pipeline ->  Configure -> Project is Parameterize -> apply the same. DONE!

Further, We're going to do a similar thing but Instead of params with Devs, we're gonna do the same with User. **USER INPUT PIPELINE**. Works similar as same as this but getting Input from the user with a parameterized Jenkins Build Job but from User.

**Objective2:** We're gonna do the same as printing the version of Gradle, Maven, Git, Docker but with Pipeline but not jobs.
Install it all and Declare environment variables by adding the path and build the same.
#### JENKINS 101 and What it does:
Jenkins Mascot, a butler & a fork of Hudson. Hudson is a discontinued software which is now Jenkins. Hudson, Jenkins are the names of Butlers in Movies and TV Shows. Means 1) It serves, 2) Jenkins Does Nothing, where butlers does nothing too. The context is **JENKINS DOES NOTHING** (Fresh prince of bel-air) where Butler doesn't cook but organizes chef, does do gardening but organizes. 

Just like butler, Jenkins does nothing where for pulling and pushing Jenkins can't do it, Git does. for managing dependencies, Jenkins cant do it, maven does. build and test spring boot, Jenkins can't do it, Gradle does. and so on.
#### User Input Jenkins Job/Pipeline:
Jenkins -> New Item -> Name and New Pipeline -> Ok ->  Pipeline Script -> Hello World Dropdown -> template rolled out:

Copy a stage -> Environment Variables:
``` Groovy
pipeline { 
    agent any

    stages { 
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello by admin!'
            }
        }
        stage('Software Version Stage') { 
            steps {
                bat 'mvn --version'
                bat 'gradle --version'
                bat 'git --version'
            }
        }
    }
} 
```
