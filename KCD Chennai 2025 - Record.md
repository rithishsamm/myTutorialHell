##### 2nd Half
 **Track 1:**  2.25 am → 35 min
 11) **Code, Prompt, or Both? Choices That Matter in Building Cloud Native Applications**
As developers we always have this one question “Should I ask AI or code it myself?” From GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, AI coding assistants have redefined the way we build our applications.  

But when working with cloud native technologies, should you prompt AI or write code? AI coding assistants promise faster development, but coding them yourself gives you full control and flexibility. AI excels at templating, troubleshooting, generating boilerplate code, and debugging common issues. However, it falls short where human expertise is crucial - building distributed systems, scalability, security, etc.  
  
In this talk, we'll examine when AI truly accelerates development and when it becomes a bottleneck through real-world scenarios. using AI tools and scenarios. We'll also provide a decision making framework with guidelines that participants can use to maximize productivity while choosing between AI assistants and human expertise.

13) **Next-Gen Kubernetes: High-Availability in a 2-Node Micro Edge Cluster** - 3:00 pm → 35 min
Today most of the organizations moving towards Cloud Native technologies which lead to the adoption of Kubernetes as an orchestration platform. For Data Centers and Cloud Based Infrastructures it's not a huge challenge since in most of the scenarios availability of the compute resources is not a challenge. When it comes to Edge Based Distribution environments, ensuring high availability, scalability and reliability remains a critical challenge since availability of minimum three nodes at Edge Side believed to be an overhead

Hence, our approach focuses on creating a Highly Available Two-Node Kubernetes Cluster that maintains operational integrity and reliability, even in scenarios where traditional solutions might fall short. We also made sure that data replication happens in real time so that even on failure of any node, data integrity can be maintained across the cluster. We have developed and tested our solution even on minimal resource enabled micro edge devices
