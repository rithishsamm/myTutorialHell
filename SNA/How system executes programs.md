**Identify the things which are a computer and which are not a computer.**

Why such things are computer and some are not?
*Whichever an electronic device that computes is a computer which it takes input and process it someway and it throws back as an output in some form*. It can be a 
- Task
- Value
- Action

In order for a computer to perform these are,
- CPU (processor)
- RAM (current short memory, presence of mind, the neocortex)
- STORAGE (long term storage)
Also the computer doesn't need to have input or output but to just to process. 

Base rules of a system,
- CPU <=> RAM,
- CPU -> Storage (gives instructions to the device to load values to the RAM, RAM serves back)
Will see in practice, understand these conceptually for now. 

What RAM do?
==Whatever you see in display is possible only if a RAM exist in a system.== (all depends on Processing Speed - ram got 100 GB/s, where storage got 5 GB/s).

What Storage do?
Storage stores the data as non-volatile. Can store and retrieve far fetched.
 
What CPU do?
- Fetch  - (from RAM)
- Decode - ()  
- Execute
- Store
