# Orientation video of the Full stack Web engineering course| Self-made Ninja Academy| Sibidharan SNA

Description: WELCOME CLASS This 30 Day journey will teach you the depth of the role of Web Engineering in real-time applications, progressive applications, and the security infrastructure involved with it.

**INSIGHTFUL TALK, FAQ AND THEORY SESSION:**
1) Self Intro
2) State of current educational system
3) About SNA, building **LearnTech** instead of **Edtech**..
4) Making impact in the education space by simplifying and making things accessible. 
5) How SNA and the platform as a service helps do that. 
6) Accessing SNA and services, using `gitlab-auth`
7) Services of SNA using `gitlab-auth`
- Selfhosted `gitlab` server - [git.selfmade.ninja](https://git.selfmade.ninja)
- SNA LMS - [academy.selfmade.ninja](https://academy.selfmade.ninja)
- SNA Labs - [labs.selfmade.ninja](https://labs.selfmade.ninja)
- SNA Forum [deprecated] - [discuss.selfmade.ninja](https://dsicuss.selfmade.ninja)
8) Importance and habituating `git`
9) Why such services, purpose or use case of having labs - Everyone to be connected in a virtual environment. 
10)  Learn `git` from Sibidharan from YouTube - [Video](https://youtu.be/na5Zt2XFwRY?si=Vb6WIVjfZp7zoURT)

###### SNA Labs - [labs.selfmade.ninja](https://labs.selfmade.ninja)
Why `labs`?
Traditional institutions have their sake of having a learning environment to do practical things in the name of labs is nothing but  old, outdated, deprecated machines and technologies for reasonable reasons due to cost, expertise and maintenance. BUT THE PRICE IS THE COST IS HAVING AN EFFECT IN OUR QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND LEARNING.

Redefining the meaning of laboratory, ==Alternatively, SNA Labs - [labs.selfmade.ninja](https://labs.selfmade.ninja) built on the same idea providing experimental and practicing environment where we everyone is virtually connected in a virtual network and with the services regardless of machines, network, interconnectivity and much such factors.== Without worrying about what will happen to the system making troubles, errors. AND GET ALL THE TAKEAWAYS TO IMPLEMENT THE SAME IN THE REAL WORLD SCENARIOS TOO.

11) Logging in and accessing labs - [Video](https://youtu.be/zVeM-hTeqwA?si=1oOW0tFnqtbG18ZL)
12) Interconnectivity of services under `SNA-LABS`
13) Definition of **Web Engineering**
14) What is engineering? Solving Realtime problems by building solutions
15) **Engineering - Art of using STEM to efficiently solve a problem**
16) Disciplines of an engineer. 
17) Web engineering - more than CS where connecting systems to solve problems
18) What is web? literally everything that connects to web
19) Here, how can we make such systems to make things work solving a problem
20) Engineering a system in web if works in a system, should work in across systems too.
21) One such big system lying in multiple machine subset eg: Facebook, form together, connect together to create meaningful data. 

> **22) Web Engineering - create, build and managing such complex, complicated systems easily and efficiently.**
End of the day its a page that gets prints on the browser but that ends just there? So, not just a site but systems that are on top of each other:
After this you can be able to build,
- Website
- Web Application
- Web Infra and such.
Will see about the systems by dividing it,

23) Levels of Perception:
- Web page construction
- Web page design
- Web site design
- Web site construction
- Web based system
- Web project (Planning and management)
---> Results as a Web Infrastructure

24) Difference between web page, site and app
- Page - Just a page showing just about a particular subject and content  
- Site - Combo of pages built under a same structure changes content but the whole page. Provides navigation between pages. (oriented to present about and around a subject or an organization)
- App - A fully dynamic system that can be able to assess to reading, writing and processing data ensuring an interaction and work accordingly in between.
- Bonus: Infra - Collection of multiple apps and systems that works appropriate and accordingly by talking and working with each other together. (any systems that works in a scale )
![[Pasted image 20250218155443.png]]

25) Disclosure: Building and Architecting all these systems
26) Combination of all these is a web engineer, not full-stack
27) Index: Web Infra - Combo of multiple apps and services
- DevOps - Dev + Ops (From creation to deployment)
- From creation, QC, QA, observability, maintenance and a lot in the middle To deployment
- Scale of building and maintaining infra (which has to operate by provisioning meaningful communication dynamically from multiple servers but under a common datastore *not one common database by the way*)
- Cycle of devops: Plan -> code -> build -> test -> release -> deploy -> operate -> monitor
- How to practice all this easily, simply, effectively and efficiently 

28) Conventional web development (code management using just ftp or other common protocol) -  THINKING BEYOND THESE,
29) Not just that mundane action but automating, manipulating and orchestrating data (CI/CD)
30) Establishing autonomy for setting up and operating an infrastructure
31) Evading *it works on my machine* problem using DevOps
32) How can we build all these on a larger scale is the thing.
33) How to observe and understand other system's stack and scale
34) and trying to replicate the system on a similar scale (such as video delivery, content delivery, storage systems) with industry standard practices, techniques and technologies
35) and also covering Other major crucial factors, such as
36) **Code Architecture** - Accounts for starting and maintaining a full-on project from scratch
- Maintaining a source code
- Naming conventions
- File and directory structure of projects
- Working with multiple files (instead of just one file like we practiced in the institutions) and to reuse the same
- Code reusability
- Code composability
- Future upgradation
- Compatibility
- Task Management
- Automation
- Documentation
- Overall maintenance of the code (whether it is a snippet or the whole project itself) (clean and readable code for even others to work with)
- If the code works in an IDE, has to work on a or multiple other systems too. Can able to play on all of these grounds
how to maintain a source code. 
ALL THE BEST PRACTICE OF CODING A PROJECT AND PROGRAMMING A SYSTEM. 

37) **Server and Network Architecture** - Accounts for making systems and things work in-between along with deployment, All about systems
- Instead of just simple and outright, buying a domain from a vendor, enabling c-panel , setting up `ftp` and moving code using`ftp`. 
- But embracing more layer of robust stuff such as VPS, VPN, Proxies and such.
- `SCP` protocol, instead of `ftp`.
- ALL ABOUT SYSTEMS - Focused on managing and concepts relying heavily on deployment, hardware, maintaining performance to cost ratio, optimization, reliability, low latency, high availability, geolocating and content delivery (localization l10n and Internationalization i18n (*globalization*))
-  Server - machine that exist, network - the server that lies on and being a part of. 
- Why network architecture matters - In terms of scaling and such, having a server and database under a single umbrella can't scale and secure
- If a complex system is running on top of thousands of servers means, In order for that app to work together means, SHOULD SOMEHOW SHARE A COMMON DATASTORE. Is it possible if the server and DB lies within together?
- Not just DB but replace all the same with lots of different services. 
- Services such as mail server, storage server, media services, compute server, CDN systems. How to make all these work together and how we can link them with all the others.
- Server architecture - Server Frontend of having multiple servers working for the users, 
- Network architecture - Server Backend of making that servers work together with the multiple services under the hood sending and receiving shared resources within. 
- Server Architecture + Network Architecture = Web Infra

38) We are going to all through software instead of provisioning and setting up hardware resources using SDN - Software Defined Networking
- SDN - Software Defined Networking
- Will be using `Docker` for such thing
- With docker, will see more of how can we do infras, how can we plan all these things, scaling containers, running multiple containers using `docker-compose`, making distributed systems to work together with common shared resources and services
- Make a venture out of this by doing this.

39) All things Defensive Security: OWASP TOP10, Do's and don't of building and breaking web, JavaScript debugging techniques, anti-JavaScript debugging techniques, JavaScript Obfuscation, Standard JS Obfuscation techniques and more areas which is responsible for securing web.

40) UI development
41) PHP with OOPS - Core medium of language
42) will be building APIs and web sockets
43) Practices such as clean and secure coding, QA, QC, 
44) Task Management using node.js
45) End Project and activities - at the end of the cohort - Group of four will be divided. 
- Pre Hackathon - each to build each module for building an app. 
- Hackathon - Online - Build what the best you can do within 24 hrs. without sleep.
- Prizes for top and best performers 
- Certifications - participation and completion with stars
THIS IS WEB ENGINEERING.

**Disclaimer:**
46) Not so easy, heavy effort will be demanded to master the same, 
47) Consistency and dedication
48) No piracy
