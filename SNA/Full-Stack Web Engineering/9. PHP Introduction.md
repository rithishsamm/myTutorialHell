#### Getting started with PHP:

Since we are going to dwelve very much of PHP, it is a must know thing to refer to its [documentation]( https://www.php.net/docs.php)

Here, we will be using more of Version:7.4 since it is very stable comparably. Will be very easy to understand if you are a prominent user but will stick to this now.


> [!NOTE] What is PHP? 
> PHP - HyperText Preprocess
> AÂ **popular general-purpose scripting language**Â that is especially suited to web development.  
Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your blog to the most popular websites in the world.

We know what hyper-text is. A type format that prints text like any other but more for Web and browsers.

> Likewise PHP, a preprocessor. processes its input data to produce output (server-side rendering) to print that data which that is used as input in another program.

To understand this statement above in brief from the PHP's context:
==**PHP - Hypertext's Preprocessor.**
**To a webpage or other hypertext to get it rendered, somewhere in the backend has to pick that hypertext file and serve it in the browser for us is the key point. WE SAW THAT IN BRIEF BY LEARNING `HTTP` right?**==

Where we right this `php` file? - **in a server.** 
What that `php` will give us? - **an Output, processes the request to provide the hypertext and that processed output get throwed as output.**

We saw more of these hypertext as in `html`, `xhtml` and more. Here, for PHP to render the output, will get started here by setting up and get going:

In vscode or CLI:
```
mkdir htdocs/projectname
cd htdocs/projectname
touch hello.php
```

In `hello.php`
```
Hello World
```
save and open that file in your browser.

Simply prints ==Hello world==. Will be getting started from here.

Seems like a simple task but under the hood, there will be a server which serves this from the local filesystem -> to us on browser (`http` servers such as `Apache`, `nginx`) 
> serves relevant file which we request 
> with the help of `http` protocol by doing `GET` and `POST` Methods. Provisions content this way. We all know that.

So far, it is all basic like any other program. 

> ==**Now, we will be diving deep into `PHP`, its capabilities and what it can do for us.** ==

#### PHP BASICS
to get started and understand in brief: it is mandatory for us to refer the documentation (cheat sheets works too).

For that we have,
- [learnxinyminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/), Take a whirlwind tour of your next favorite language. Community-driven!
- [devdocs](https://devdocs.io/), DevDocs combines multiple API documentations in a fast, organized, and searchable interface.

Okay!.
Simply, how web works by `http` which we already know is,
- there will be a system/server
- as user, we will send a `http` request to that system/server
- that request will look like
```http
GET/index.html-v1.1
<headers>
...
..
.
</headers>
```

**WILL SEE HOW `PHP` WORKS FROM A DIFFERENT POV:**

Before diving deep, will revise what we know already and will proceed from there. 

-> LETS SAY WE HAVE A SERVER:
We will be sending `http` request as a user and eventually which will respond back,
> `USER` ----- `http`[GET URL/`index.html`+otherHeaders] INPUT -----> `SERVER`
> `USER` <----- `http`[POST URL/`index.html`+otherHeaders] OUTPUT <----- `SERVER`
WHEREAS, THIS *web server* here is simply an `apache` machine.

here, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE SERVER IS ==SERVE WHATEVER HAS BEEN REQUESTED REGARDLESS OF ANY FORMAT.== SPEAKING OF FORMATS, THE SERVER GIVES ==**HIGH PRIORTIES TO SELECTIVE FORMATS**==. 
Will prove this in practice soon. well, instead of this index.html files, we can request lots of other files/formats. 
such actions as: Browser -> Inspect -> Network -> Resources. 
1) So, who is delivering 
2) what types of files that you can request to be delivered to us from a web server? 
The responsible of sending files to and fro from server to client is **THE SERVER ITSELF. THE SERVING AND DELIVERY duty is of `web-server`'s.**

*Here, There is a fight for which file format has to be set default and prioritized to be served. 

NOW, WILL DO THE PRIORITY EXPERIMENTAION IN PRACTICE. 
1) Setup a workspace:
2) Create and enter a directory
```
mkdir web
cd web
```
3) create web files with content:
```
touch index.html
touch index.php
```
 4) `index.html` write some
```
Welcome message from HTML
```
5) `index.php`:  write some
```
php is the goat
```
