Description: Learn how to create your first AI agent step by step.

 Weâ€™ll cover the basic setup, how it works, and help you build a simple working agent by the end.

We have gone through the Orientation of the same and some Introduction to Prompt Engineering out of Prompt Engineering guide. 

Now will see more of Chain-of-Thought as we left lastly and create first and more AI-Agent. 

For Chain-of-Thought, will follow further with the following practices. Keep those Prompt Engineering on the side,

And, now Will jump straight into `n8n`.

For the same, do recharge with OpenAI API Platform - [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) -> Settings -> [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) -> Add $5 where it is easy to follow up with. 

And lets walk through with,

### N8n:
Self host `n8n` or navigate to 
-  `labs.selfmade.ninja` -> Login -> Machine Labs -> `n8n Lab` -> Redeploy and Launch -> `n8n`.
- Login with Username and Password,
- `n8n` UI. 

LET'S GET STARTED FROM HERE,
Will see more of `n8n` 's,
- UI,
- `n8n` environment, 
- Server Setup, 
- File sharing, 
- Creating Simple `n8n` agents, 

**Brief History:** 
`n8n` was an fairly open sourced, low code, no code workflow automation tool which was created at 2019. Back then, it was a fancy and generic automation tool which just integrates with apps and tools with each other and automate it. 

But after AI and more, it also connects with the same helping to do more automation powered with AI. Then AI-Agents got introduced and changed to a whole new thing, how we work, how to integrate, communicate all together.

Now, it helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code.

- Customizable: highly flexible workflows and the option to build custom nodes.
- Convenient: use the npm or Docker to try out n8n, or the Cloud hosting option if you want us to handle the infrastructure.
- Privacy-focused: self-host n8n for privacy and security.

##### Fresh SNA `n8n` setup:

-  `labs.selfmade.ninja` -> Login -> Machine Labs -> `n8n Lab` ->deploy -> IP and Confirm Deploy.
- Launch and Login to `n8n`

###### `N8N` Login and Walk-through,
- Login
- Enter customizations,
- Get started,
- Get `n8n` key via mail,
- Select Bottom self [...] -> Settings -> Usage and Plan -> Enter Activation Key and done.
- License activated and all good, 

###### Dashboard [myN8n](https://e732914edead77115dd978cf10d9b48b.n8n.selfmade.codes/home/workflows)
Shows,
Left Menu; 
- `+` icon,
- Overview,
- Personal
- Shared with you,
- 
- Bottom left - Below,
- Templates,
- Variables,
- Insights
- Help 
- Profile (Sign-out and Setting)

###### Overview:
- Dashboard with status, 
- Create Workflow `+` - Button,
- Three tabs - Workflows, Credentials, Executions. 

###### - `Overview- > Workflows Tab`:  


### Creating first AI-Agent:
- Start from scratch
- **Test a simple AI Agent Example - click**

##### Workflow:
- Test a simple AI Agent Example - click - **Opens an example,** 
UI, 
![https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*0f2a21nhj2lCc-v3[0\*0f2a21nhj2lCc-v3](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*0f2a21nhj2lCc-v3)

What this means, 
- we configure an `Agent`, 
- We pass our model here for the `agent` to work,

But here, we got nothing,  none of our model is here, no credentials have been registered here.  

**There will be an option at the Top-right corner named - Set-up Template,** there it asks ,
-> `OpenAI Chat Model - Create new OpenAI Chat Model Credential.` BUT THE UI that we end up having, is a template of itself. 

##### Credentials:
For the agent to work, back to OpenAI API Platform 
	- [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) -> Settings -> [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview) -> Add $5.
	- [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) -> API keys -> Create New secret key -> Name, Select Project, Permissions (All or Restricted Zero trust permissions) -> **Create Secret key**
	- Copy keys, 
	- And done. 

>  *Note: Distribute `api-keys` by creating different > projects.* 

In order to make a **communication establishment between a machine to machine,**
**`api-keys`**. 

`n8nPractice1:`
***-> `n8n` -> Credentials -> Connection -> `copiedAPIkey`, `orgId` (getFromOpenAI), `basrURL: https://api.openai.com/v1`*** 


Just for for a `user` to auth using `username` and `password`.  There are more to it but for now, will stick with `api-keys`,

WILL SET UP A PROPER AI-Agent AFTER GETTING THINGS RIGHT. 
**Back to Dashboard:** 

##### [[2. First AI-Agent#Workflow]]:

**Dashboard:** `n8n` ->  select `last Workflow` -> `canvas` -> select `OpenAI` node -> there:
Parameter:
**Credentials**: `OpenAI Account`,
**Model**: `gpt-4.1-nano`, (or anyOther. Since this one is the cheapest)
**Options:** `none or default blank`

Leaving it all here,
