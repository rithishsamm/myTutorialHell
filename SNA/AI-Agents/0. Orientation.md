### Understanding the landscape: 

We can able to definite and separate the world Before `OpenAI` and After `OpenAI` later the launch of `ChatGPT`, a generational shift then we can split equivalent to `AD` and `BC`.

Which is simple introduction of `LLMs` to the world.  

After the context of AI, there are major shift that had occurred in humanity that:
- How far the impact and the effects that it has on a common man,
- How it improvises a person's day-to-day life,
- How it promotes self-taught learning,
- Help assisting,
- Helps providing solutions, decision making, giving refined suggestions and more
This is how life has been with `AI` . 

But here we can do better. Instead of us felling into being a dependent dystopian loser user, how do we able to leverage and power of AI and making it works for us to make our lives easier with the help of tools and technologies. 

- What are all the prerequisites and technical capabilities for us to know to get this running for both programmers and non-programmers. 
 - How do we deploy it in a production scale
 - Beyond chat-bots and small automation tasks. 
- Building Specialized and moderated content out of AI

Will dig deep into this. 

###### Before digging deep, will understand the capabilities of what it can do and what it can't do. 

Reffering to one of Apple's AI Research [paper](https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/papers/the-illusion-of-thinking.pdfhttps://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/papers/the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf) and [publication](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking) is that,
```cardlink

title: "The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity"

```

Will decipher what the paper is trying to deliver. 

This is an analysis of some wider range of models to perform specific tasks, such as giving puzzle environment as Tower of Hanoi, Checkers Jumping, River Crossing, Blocks world and more. 

Here, the thing is that ==THE MODELS WE CALL `AI` ARE NOT FULLY `AI`. A SUPER PATTERN MATCHING MACHINE THAT JUST THROWS WHATEVER WE ASK REGARDLESS OF THE QUALITY THAT GIVES. 

TO A POINT WHERE IT CAN'T AND THROWS BULLSHIT WHEN IT REACHES ITS MAX. ==

These claims are expressed after the analysis of AI by performing tasks which we referred above. 
[[0. Orientation#Before digging deep, will understand the capabilities of what it can do and what it can't do.]]


A short and reality check before digging deep into overestimating the power of AI. So, lets be aware of what AI can do,  can't do, what problem to give to AI, what not to give to AI and its limitations. 

To understand the same more in brief, refer in this  [paper](https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/papers/the-illusion-of-thinking.pdfhttps://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/papers/the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf) 's charts placed above the topic - 4. Experiment and Results, 

There, the charts indicated the test results of each model's performance of those specific tasks. 
There,
- each model performs the same when it does it's actual work with 3 disks.
- Fails after it gets to add more. 
- To point where it just fails without putting any effort.
- After that, the chart clearly indicates the just gives up after few iterations.
- IT JUST BREAKS AT A POINT.
REGARDLESS OF WHICHEVER SUPERIOR MODEL IT IS. 

 [refer this one too](https://youtu.be/SauAZxz_Q14?si=AScgLNCb_BQVmub_) which is being very inefficient, repetitive and lacks QUALITY.
 
### TLDR: 
 1) Every model fails eventually after more complexity added to it gradually.
 2) They(model) think less when it gets harder. - uses less tokens and just gives up halfway without putting much effort to it. 
 3) AI fatigue, AI Burnout, AI Functional Paralysis is real.  
 4) There is a sweet spot and a cliff 
 5)  Instructions and out right solutions doesn't helping to process further. Keeps failing and gives up even after giving it all to AI. Regardless of how superior the Model is.
 6) Reasoning is inconsistent.
 7) **tldr**: Well dressed very capable illusion, just a high speed and highly confident pattern matcher.

==Just like humans.== It is the AI's burnout. THESE MODELS WORKS JUST LIKE OUR BRAIN. 

In simple terms, 
- a human brain is capable of compute, 
- But can't able to process at a time to an extent.  (eg: add this big number with this big number). CAN'T
- If we have essential tools to do such thing, can do, 
- THAT IS THE CORE OF `AI-Agents. 

##### Why It matters?
**Coz we gonna deal with multiple and complex problems where we don't want an unreliable AI systems to fail on us.** In order to make it reliable, we get multiple but specialized AI systems altogether to make it refined and reliable AI systems. 

**How it works is just like - hiring and training a person to do a work for me.** and you do your training and instruct and specialize them to do these and these. 

==Likewise, we instruct AI to do this and this buy prompt lines and lines of instructions to behave in a certain manner. ==

**CORE Prerequisite**: How i give instructions to AI to do the work in the manner that we instructed. 

In `.role` like we instruct to a person, do the same to the model,

Prompt and Rules:
- You should do this,
- You should do that, 
- It must be like this,
- You should not give, if they ask this way.
- If user ask this, give this 
- If user ask that, give that.
And all.  

You cannot prompt it all in a single day. You keep on refining it by moderating and instructing more prompt day-by-day. It is a continuous process. 

**QUALITY, Refining/REFINED OUTPUT ARE THE GOALS HERE.** - also refer [paper](https://youtu.be/SauAZxz_Q14?si=AScgLNCb_BQVmub_)

And AI doesn't compute.

**Why there is a NEED for AI-Agents?**
**Why these publicly available models aren't enough?** 
**What are we gonna do about the red areas that contains complex problems for the AI to make it happ**en?

Simple,
>  ==**JUST BREAK IT ALL DOWN INTO SMALLER STEPS AND GIVE EACH STEPS AN `AI` TO SOLVE.==** 

THIS IS THE NEED FOR `AI-Agents`.

You can differentiate problems into two parts:
- Some require logical way of solving, (can use code for these)
-  Some require smarter and creative way of solving. (can use GenAI and such).

Also, 
- model becomes mature day by day,
- Their memory gets refined day-to-day,
- So, do not trust numbers with these AI models, they might bluff.
**Two bitter tit for tat tradeoff truth.** 

---

So,
### AI-Agents,
Is nothing but we give all the 
- essential tools,
- access,
- credentials,
- by setting up nodes and
- giving triggers to it and
- build a workflow and
Ultimatley,
We give Instructions to it telling 
- you are this, 
- you have this,
- if i ask u this, 
- you go here anddo this and
- you go there and get that 
- after doing this and more. 
**This is how it works in hindsight,** 

How to implement such AI-Agents and setup the whole infra to this. 

Before diving into all these, we first cover everything about 
1) prompt engineering and go one by one into 
2) LLM integration
3) Webhook and Form pipelines
4) Decision Logic
5) Agent Memory (MongoDB)
6) Production deployment
7) MCP Orchestration 

All we start from `n8n` and all from theory to technical. 

---

### n8n
We learn what is ,
- Nodes,
> - (AI (and wider range of AI), 
> - Action in app trigger(all the App Integrations), 
> - Data transformation(bot),
> - Flow(gramming),
> - Core(), 
> - Human in loop(human in-between for validation), 
> - Triggers (app action).)
- Workflows
- Triggers 
- Secrets 
- Auth (userPasswd, Access token, oAUth, JWT, API key based auth, )
- IAM 
- And more.

We are not gonna code, but we are dealing with systems anyway. 
- How we gonna use,
- How we gonna deploy agents,
- What are all the `auth` methods,
- How to communicate with other apps, 
- How to talk via `http`
- How leverage `http` to communicate effectively with systems, 
- How we talk to different servers with such protocols and all. 
- Learning about systems,
- Network 
- `http` requests,
-   different type protocols to use,
- Different type of AI protocols that are available for us to use. 
- And a lot more.

Gonna cover such technical things since we don't code but
- we have to talk to systems,
- doing what the programmers do,
- how it will be beneficial to us and such.

Eg: **A gitlab bot agent:**
There it have access to,
- Gitlab repos
- Gitlab issues
- Gitlab Comment on Issue
- Gitlab PR
- Gitlab Artifacts
- Gitlab Readme
- Gitlab CI and much more. 

So, for an `n8n` workflow,
Prompt: You simply ask about the project in the chat
With having all these access to all these `Gitlab`, it knows where to go and what to do as we instructed to behave in a manner and do stuff. So, the working behind these is,
- Chat 
- Receives `input`,
- Saves the input in memory
- Goes to an AI model,
- Model picks theright tool and that is where it all the prompt lies in it to get the job done, 
- Picks the right tool given to it,
- Goes to the tool, 
- Fetches data,
- Saves the output back in memory
- Outputs. 
Gets the job done this way. Also you can get logs and clear memory and execution. 

These are all simple text agents. Will do more out of these. 

There are multiple type of agents, such as
- Browser as Agent - `browseruse`,
- LangAgent - `Langchain`,
- LLM, 
- Reasoning, RAG, 
- GenAI and much more. 

---

##### WHAT ABOUT SECURITY?
- Secrets are maintained, 
- Data control - data retention and sharing, 
- Data retention control can be administrated. 
- Consent, 
- Access data, 
- Human in loop. 

Still the tech in immature. Will get along with the same.  
Also, add $5 in API Platform - [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) -> Settings -> [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)
