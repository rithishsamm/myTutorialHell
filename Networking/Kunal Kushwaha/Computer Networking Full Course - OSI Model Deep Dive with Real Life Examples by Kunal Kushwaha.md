#### Introduction
![[CN1.png]]
How things over internet and deep down of the following..
 What is network> - Computers that are connected together.
 Internet? -> Collection of networks
#### How it all started? 
![[CN2.png]]
Cold War -> US vs USSR -> soviet Won -> ARPANET -> Communicate within research projects and collaboration -> MIT, UCLA, STANFORD, UTAH (Comms) -> Used TCP Protocol for this -> 
What is Protocols?
e.g: e-mail -> to make a functioning like a mail service, needs some specific required steps + this has to sent here to here via this way with this standards and all + same thing by handling internet in different types of ways. -> Defining such RULES, standards and policy makings are PROTOCOLS. TCP /IP , UDP Protocols so on and so forth. will see more into what protocols are in detail.
//since we are in the initial stage relevant to this context.
missing components
1) links: at that earlier stage, document or resources interlinking were missing. if there is a research paper exist that refers to this research paper means, it isn't doable.

Tim berners lee came into picture created WWW(World Wide Web) -> Worlds First Website:https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
allows to access documents holed under WWW.
2) search: searching such documents and such were missing. History of search engine for ore context. YAHOO was the first one.

=> Why Protocols?, Why do we need rules and such?
Imagine making an application. Different ways of communicating via different channels and application for different purposes.

Who writes such protocols? -> The Internet Society. -> For our own protocol and such, make a submission in RFC Editor -> submit and will things get done.
will see how it all works internally.
#### Client-Server Architecture
usual examples of Client vs Server
#### Protocols
![[CN3.png]]
Protocols = Rules
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (Making sure it reaches its destination by ensure all the way through)
UCP -> User datagram protocol (It just spits data doesn't care if it does reach its destination or not but to give data as derived.)
HTTP -> Hypertext transfer protocol Web Client and Server (is used by web browsers) defines the format of the data being transferred over the web.
will see more on this later.
#### How Data is Transferred? IP Address (IP identifies computers)
![[CN4.png]]
Okay? protocols exist and all are cool.
How the data gets transferred from one to another? since everything in computers are in 0's and 1's. Making a request as a whole doesn't make isn't efficient -> so it sends it all as packets.
Inspect -> Network -> Reload -> Individual Calls in different different Packets of data.

To derive the same and making it reachable from one end to another -> made possible by OSI Model.

How does a request knows it's destination -> IP Address and basic idea behind it by addressing individuals and devices. all the 255.255.255.255 IP's and more. Points each to each. will see more on types of IP's Reserved IP's and more. 

ISP -> gives modem -> gives Local IP's for each devices -> and the private IP's  for each with the help of DHCP + NAT which helps translating device IP's to DHCP given virtual local IP's and making such connection.
![[CN5.png]]
#### Port Numbers (identifies applications)
![[CN6.png]]
same applies to the devices and applications which are derived and distributed to make and send requests from multiple application with the help of Port Number. Port number denotes that which application that it communicates with.

Ports - 16it numbers -> 2^16 ~= 65000
PORTS - 0 - 1023 => are reserved ports (for systems and such)
1024 - 49152 => port for apps (are for applications) e.g.: MongoDB - 27017, SQL - 1433
Remaining's are for personal use.

if i create my own application, i can take whatever ports but not between 0 - 1023 since those are reserved for system or other services and applications..
e.g.: Services interface that are on port, WEBPAGES - http - 80, MongoDB - 27017

**INTERNET IN BRIEF:**

![[CN7.png]]
Bandwidth: (bps - > bits per sec) - Upload and download Inbound Outbound Connection.
1mbps - 1000000 bits/s
1gbps - 10^9 bits/s
1kbps - 1000 bits/s
whats the matter? what and all making this possible and such?
by two ways. 
1) Guided Way
2) Unguided Way

How it is all connected?
#### Submarine Cables Map (Optical Fiber Cables)
search: submarinecables
mode of connectivity - 
Physical:  underground waterways optic fiber cables, Co-axial cables and more
Wireless: Bluetooth, Wifi, 3G, 4G LTE and more
#### LAN, MAN, WAN
Modes of networks
Local- small areas, Metropol - town, city, Wide - across countries via fiber optic cables.
![[CN8.png]]
#### MODEM, ROUTER
Modem -> Converts digital signals to analog
#### Topologies (BUS, RING, STAR, TREE, MESH)
Network topologies:
**BUS** - one breaks spoils every network, one at a time
![[CN9.png]]
**RING** - one disconnects nothing goes in-between where all connects with one another
![[CN10.png]]
**STAR** - if control breaks all goes down
![[CN11.png]]
**TREE** - little prone to failures and not a good pratice.
![[CN12.png]]
**MESH** - modern practice -> expensive, scaling issue and more 
![[CN13.png]]
#### Structure of the Network (OSI)
Lets break it all down to smaller pieces. as r
IRL, One step at a time that a data that gets pass through at one on each level of layer => All actions between Sending and Receiving a request and response.
![[CN14.png]]

#### OSI Model (7 Layers)
![[CN15.png]]
![[CN16.png]]
#### TCP/IP Model (5 Layers)
mostly similar to OSI. lil bits of changes. 
THE INTERNEL PROTOCOL SUITE by ARPANET.
idea is, Not seven layers but 5. OSI is more of a conceptual but here it is theoretical and used practically.
where, app + presentation + session = Application Layer -> are merged into one. App ->Transport -> Network -> Data Link -> Physical.

Deep dive in this.
**Application Layer:**
![[CN17.png]]
![[CN18.png]]
Why Application layer, responsibilities?, why does this exist?
-> Main layer, consist of various apps, where users interact and such.
e.g: whatsapp, browser and more.
-> Where does it lie? -> in devices.

Upcoming Agenda:
-> Protocols of the layer? 
-> Client Server Architecture?
#### Client Server Architecture
How apps talk to each other?
Server? -> one that process a request and response. (Cloud, Datacenters)
Client? -> one who makes the request and the consumer in general.(users devices)
![[CN19.png]]
#### Peer to Peer Architecture
another type of architecture. like One connected to one another directly without navigating across networks and each can be turned into either client or as a server. more like a decentralized architecture. e.g.: torrent
#### Networking Devices (Download PDF)
https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DevOps-Bootcamp/blob/main/Networking/Networking%20Devices.pdf
Repeater -> Physical layer. Accelerator or keeps the connection going by repeating the connection for not cutting down the connection in whole.
Hub -> Multiport repeater that interconnect multiple devices.
Hub Types? Active - 
refer the rest in the pdf.
#### Protocols
**TCP/IP PROTOCOLS:**
Application layer thing. in web - tcp/ip, for file sharing - ftp, for email - smtp and more. will see the same.
Web and rest:
HTTP - Hyper text transfer protocol - defines  how data transfers over the internet
HTTPS - secure (data that are encoded) - secured under utf8 or other encryption standards.
DHCP - Dynamic host control protocol - allocated IPs to connected devices
FTP - deprecated since data can be transferred via http too.
SMTP - How emails work, helps to Send emails
POP3 & IMAC - to receive emails
SSH - accessing remote terminals. Port 22
VNC - Virtual Network Computing - Graphical control
Telnet - Terminal emulator that enables a user to remote / host or a device using a telnet client. Port 23 (low level protocol)
![[CN20.png]]

**UDP PROTOCOL:** STATELESS CONNECTION. does not maintain the state.  throws data regardless of no consistent. Data may get lost in this.

DEEP DOWN ON THESE PROTOCOLS.
![[CN21.png]]
e.g: WhatsApp -> since all of these lies under Application Layer.
has some processes in it. One program has many processes in order to make things work
Process: does messages, records media and such. an application that can run many process at once.
+
Thread: a lighter version of a process. does one single job. also does multithreading helping run programs on multiple cases. a process can contain multiple running threads.
Messaging -> render page, enable keyboard and such
Recording media -> Open camera, start triggers to record, access FS to save it. 
like these.

How does each communicate with each other. How does the app or the internet determines that this msg has to be delivered right over here.  - Addresses and Ports.
#### Sockets
Sockets -> messaging -> Interface between the internet and software that the just spits data from one another.
#### Ports (works with services or application that we work with)
opens links but if we opens up multiple ports means, how does it know that this has to open in the corresponding browser and such. - with the help of Ephemeral Ports.
#### HTTP
![[CN22.png]]
in brief,
http -> hyper text transfer protocol + client server architecture = a protocol that tells us how you request this data from server & tells us how the server will sends back the data to the client -> the request -> http request, response for that request be like, you want to access this page?, here u g (serves a bunch of files to assess the app).
every app layer is dependent and needs to work with + require  some sort of transport layer protocol one way or another.

There are METHODS to make this communication possible.
GET - to get something
POST - to post the request
PUT - Enter something within
DELETE - delete

server does not store any kind of data by default <- HTTP (app layer) (stateless protocol) - uses TCP (- transport layer)
TCP is connection oriented which just has to get established and have nothin to do with any  sort of application stuff SO no data will get lost.

RESPONSE: whenever something we get in response for that in a web page - is simply a collection of webpages and its corresponding data that contains links, text, media, documents, objects -> each of this has it's specific URL according to the location of its directories. - WWW

Will see that in brief:
Browser -> Inspect -> Network -> pick a component on a webpage(just a random click even works) -> right click to open in new tab -> even that one object has its own URL? protocol:url/linkToTheResource

Pick a resource in the network section -> check header -> Analyze Request & Response headers.

Each of that resources have GET, POST one by one, will see about METHODS in brief.
#### HTTP(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
types of these methods,
![[CN23.png]]
WHAT IS A METHOD?
METHOD is a thing that tells the server what it has to do.
GET - requesting some data (give me the webpage, gimme the YT video and such)
POST - I'm a client and I'm giving something to the server, in a web form. to register somewhere Username, pwd or whatever.
PUT - Put data at a specific location
DELETE - DELETE A DATA FROM THE SERVER, do a delete request.

Will see irl example of these methods,
select a resource -> Check headers
POST - request to that -> URL
```
request headers:
Accept:*/* //accepts connections
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br //gzip http encryption
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Authorization: SAPISIDHASH 711712091_379afc8fdd55 //authHash
Content-Length: 2944 //length
Content-Type: application/json //direction
Cookie: LOGIN_INFO=AFmmF2sSomeRandomAssEncryption
and more.. that contains in POST Method..

response header: //for that POST METHODS that we requested,
Content-Length: 151
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: require-trusted-types-for 'script'; report-uri https://csp.withgoogle.com/csp/inputtools
Content-Type: image/png

Report-To: {"group":"inputtools","max_age":2592000,"endpoints":[{"url":"https://csp.withgoogle.com/csp/report-to/inputtools"}]}
Server: sffe
```
also they comes with a status code too.
http version + the status code. will see bout that in brief.
#### Error/Status Codes
![[CN24.png]]
when you send requests to the server, The conformation of sending and receiving will happen by default  to the TCP, the user has to know too. They use status code for that. classes of error codes.
100 - Information related
200 - Success codes (OK received/request successful)
300 - Redirection
400 - Client Errors
500 - Server Errors
eg:
404 - error, could not find it
500 - internal server error
#### Cookies
![[CN25.png]]
Since the http protocol is stateless where it doesn't save but just transmits data, how does the connection keeps alive and re-login or saves login info whenever we login

Browser -> Inspect -> Network -> Request & Response -> set_cookies (saves session) + there are cookies provided by the third party providers for Advertisement and more too. 
#### How Email Works?
![[CN26.png]]
APP layer protocol- TCP -> SMTP(for sending), POP3(for receiving), following to that, which transport layer protocol that we are going to use? 
TCP OR UDP? -> UDP that u want your data to get lost? need to make sure that you need acknowledgement on each transit that it has reached its destination. -> TCP for that
E.G: sending an email from yahoo to Gmail, since each of that email service is different.

**Sender** - sends email to that mail server ->  SENDER'S SMTP SERVER (email will be there for a while) ->  makes a connection to the receiver's mail server (after connection gets established, sends all the mail gets transferred to the receiver server) - RECEIVER'S SMTP SERVER -> **Receiver** - downloads all the email from the Receiver's server (email client) => internally works by TCP.
-> IF IT IS IN THE SAME MAIL PROVIDER: this extra connection doesnt happen, sends it all directly.
+
**error handling**: eg if the receiving is offline, the sender server will keep on trying to send it on a scheduling basis  and might gives up later.

for checking mails server's info in detail, name and the ip of the mail server for various domains.
>nslookup -type=mx mailProvider.com //mailExchange

**Downloading Emails:**
**POP3** - Post Office Protocol
Workings: Client connects to the POP Server : PORT 110 -> does the authentication usrname, pwd -> Client (asks all the mails)

Client -> auth -> PopServer --> Transaction -> Client
FYI: The other items like sent items, trash, spam and draft are not get synced in this protocol.

IMAP - Internet Message access Protocols
allows you to view emails on multiple devices. Emails will be kept on the receiver mail server unless we delete it manually. local copies will be available on various devices and sync all the folders and stuff. once it gets deleted in one device, will get deleted in the synced rest of the devices too.
#### DNS (Domain Name System) 
![[CN27.png]]
DNS - Domain Name System.
URL in brief to understand this well. Domain name are mapped to IP Addresses and we use a service that acts like an address book. 

Where does this all stored, how it redirects to the web as we know it navigate to the corresponding destination: DNS (like a directory database service)

In detail, Structure of an URL: (subdomain-part of a main domain) mail.google(second lvl domain).com (top lvl domain)

(these databases of domains are divided into various classes of domains)
Classes of domains:
ROOT DNS SERVER (have all the) ->Tier 1 domains - .org, .com, .in , .me and more (TLD - Top level Domains - managed by icannn, check [root-servers.org])
Tier 2 domains - the subdomains that comes with i. brand or the company name and such.

Search of an url starts from Own Cache local data -> ISP - Local DNS server (first pint of contact) -> Root Server (redirects back if there is no .coms there) -> Top level domain > GIVES BACK THE CORRESPONDING IP ADDRESS. -> ISP Connects back to url.com
FYI: only rent no buying

>dig url.com - looks in the url details in either cache or in ISP
#### TCP/IP Model (Transport Layer)
![[CN28.png]]
Transport Layer in brief, 
- transport layer transits data from the network layer (which comes from various places) to application layer.
- does congestion control to handle traffic
- Congestion control algorithms are built in TCP Layer
eg: WhatsApp (me -> frnd) What is happening in between? what is the role of the transport layer for this case?

 **Me** - - > Transport Layer (computer to apps)= take the transit data from network layer to the application layer / Network layer (computer to computer)= transportation - - > **Friend**

analogy: as in diagram, send a package to a destination with the help of a courier service.
**Me** (package) -> (courier+addr) - - transportL > Sender Service
--- networkL - - > 
Receiver Service - - > transportL - - > **Destination** (package) 
=> where is the transport layer -> Devices 
 -- USECASES OF TRANSPORT LAYER.

here, the transport layer takes care of network to application, how does it know which application has to assess in terms of giving a specific data simultaneously  

How this works? one to one multiple actions has been happening in the same time -> like messaging on whap, vc on skype and mailing on browser..

**MULTIPLEXING AND DEMULTIPLEXING:**
Multiplexing -> sending data to multiple destination from a single medium,
Demultiplexing -> vice versa
How? Port Numbers

**all good here in the transport layer so far, what if there might be an interruption that might happen in between the transit in the NETWORK LAYER?** GETS CORRUPTED, LOST AND RECEIVE NOT IN ORDER OR WHATEVER WORST CASE?

Transport Layer also consist of a thing to ensure this case known as **CHECKSUMS**.
#### Checksum
![[CN29.png]]
WHAT IS A CHECKSUM?
Checksum is like a random ass number which contains the data's + its sequence of how it has to be presented to its destination. Calculate a particular string value that tells that the data's structure is this, it has to be presented there as same as how it was before

me - -  data + checksum --> network layer --> Receiver (receives data) - here, the checksum was calculated using the data ensures that everything is in order as it was before.
THIS PRACTICE IS ENSURE THE DATA'S FULL DELIVERY HAS BEEN DONE OR NOT.
we need to also ensure that, how do we know that the data we sent has been successfully delivered to the receiver? **TIMERS**
#### Timers
![[CN30.png]]
![[CN31.png]]
DEFAULT CASE1
ME(timer starts) -- >FRIEND(sent) -- > sends back the acknowledgement (timer stops)
sends another one -> none sent (lost if in case) -- > no acknowledgement since no packets received -- > (no acknoeledgement recieves so timer expires with a notification of Fail to sent)
**RETRANSMISSION TIMER**

CASE2 (SAME BUT...)
ME(timer starts) -- >FRIEND(sent) -- > sends back the acknowledgement (timer stops)
sends another one -> sends back the acknowledgement (timer stops) -> 
sends another one ->  sent (but..)-- > no acknowledgement sent back
(no acknowledgement receives so timer expires with a notification of Fail to sent) -> sends back the same ->  sends back the acknowledgement AND NOW WE HAVE TWO as in duplicate 
How do we resolve this?? -> SEQUENCE NUMBERS -> if such case happens, It solves the problem with the help of sequence numbers.


> [!NOTE]
> transport layer - TCP, UDP
> application layer - http and more
> Network Layer - IP's


#### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
![[CN32.png]]
USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOLS,
since we're here in the same page of transport layer, will see more into this:

Transport Layer protocol. TL <-> NL. in-between the transit, may or may not be delivered. may change on the way, data may not be in order.

UDP - Connection lets protocol
UDP uses checksums makes things in order even if it steady or stateless.

Structure/ Contents of a UDP Packet:
Source Port: 2bytes
Destination Port: 2bytes
Length of datagram(packet): 2bytes
checksum: 2bytes
header's size: 8bytes
+
Data: 
Total:2^16 -8 = 65536-8 = 65528bytes -> Data size

Usecases of UDP:
Faster, due to less acknowledgement
Video Conferencing apps
DNS uses UDP Protocol too, since it is fast
Gaming, Realtime analytics, system usage and status and more..

check Data packets in and out of your system,
>sudo tcpdump -c noOfPacktets //shows the packets as you gave the number
#### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
![[CN33.png]]
Transmission Control Protocol - TCP
transport layer = between sender's app layer and network layer +  between receiver's app layer and network layer.
-- http works under TCP, file sharing, transfer pdf, mail, https uses it, so web browsing, emails (imap, pop3, smtp) - all these app layer protocols uses? -  tcp
-- Application layer sends raw data -> TCP segments it to packets and adds header. + TL collects data from network layer ->  
-- congestion control -> 1) when data does not arrive, 2) reorder and maintains the order of data (using sequence numbers)

Features:
- Connection oriented (connection needs to be established before transfers data)
- Error control
- Congestion control
- Full duplex(Bi directional) - work in parallel without any problem
one end point to another, no medium that sends and splashes data from one system to multiples. thewy will all have their own tcp connection.
>1tcp connection between two computers

HOW DOES THIS CONNECTION HAPPENS?
#### 3-Way handshake
![[CN34.png]]
theory behind a tcp connection: 3way handshake
 Client - -> sync flag req(flag+seq.no) - - > Server 
 Client < - - syncback flag + acknowledgment flag res+seq.no(-mathWith32=56) < - - Server 
 Client(ack's response) - -> acknowledgment flag for response back + (syncF=math32+1=33,ackFlag=56+1=57) - - > Server (verifies and establishes handshake)

more flag exist too,
- sync flag - SYN
- acknowledge flag - ACK
- checksum
- reset flag - RST
- finish flag - FIN
- pass flag - PSH
- urgent flag - URG
-https://www.howtouselinux.com/post/tcp-flags - FOR MORE INFO.
#### TCP (Network Layer)
![[CN35.png]]
now will look in brief into how data gets into pieces in each layer.

the data that lies in the transport layer, 
Transport layer -> data in segments (headers+ data)
Network layer -> data in packets
Transport layer -> data in frames

here in network layer, we work with routers. lets say
SYSTEM A to B, so many router are connected between to each other.
what happens is, how does it navigate to point a to b. Every single router here has its own network address.

It makes the A to B transit possible by the method name hop by hop forwarding by having tables on each router to make a connection over here.

> hop - by -hop,  hoping router to router until it reaches the correct router. by verifying tables on reach it's routers to the corresponding destination router to deliver the message.
- these hop are possible to the according and efficient with the help of ISP
- these hops get derived under the basis of range of IP Classes. 
- There range of classes canlie int subnets to redirect through.

Structure of a packet: 
IP,
Source Network address 
Destination Network address 

Route tables: adds table's address of each in cache to forward the connection to the destination. Network layer of an address who is sending and receiving.

Structure of an IP Address:
192.168.2.30
[192.168.2]-networkAddrOfTheDevice.30-DeviceAddress

THIS IS HOW ROUTING TAKES PLACE.
we saw how it all working, BUT? 
WHO CREATED THIS TABLES AND SUCH, 
HOW DOES A ROUTER DOES PERFORM SUCH ACTION, 
HOW IF A NEW ROUTER GETS ADDED AND IT KEEP UP WITH WHAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, - Control Plane
#### Control Plane
![[CN36.png]]
in the network layer, there is something known as control plane.
**Control Plane:**
control plane to used to build/creates routing tables, like a graph.
so, every router is a node. the links between the nodes are edgers (of the graph).

Routers - > Nodes
Links - > Edgers

Two types of routing,
1) Static routing - Manual, Time consuming, configure if there is an update, new addresses has to be registered each time, Non adaptive
2) Dynamic routing - Automatic, detects and evolves over while scaling 

Algorithms are used for such routing - Path finding Graph search algorithms such as Bellman Ford, Dijkstra and more.

More of such cases like these - refer more on DSA Bootcamp. 
#### IP (Internet Protocol)
![[CN37.png]]
Network Layer Protocol - IP (Internet Protocol) addresses
in the TCP/IP model, the tcp is all above as we say. Now will look into the IP in brief.

The protocol that lies in the network layer, IP Addresses - HOSTS where all the network layer stuff such as Routing, Control Plane and IP's mainly- . uniquely put tethered numbers. IP's can be uniquely defined for any types of computing systems such as server, client, node, router and more.

practicing versions:
IPv4 - 32bitNumbers + 4words (5.6.9.19 - 8bit.8bit.8.bit.8bit = 32bit) = a bit = 8byte where it can contain value of 256.
IPv6 - future, 128bits

Route tables = box of addresses.
the Collection of tables of IP's are in Subnets. Each subnet has its own id and gets navigate through. where not to serve other's traffic too.

[192.168.2]-networkAddr/SubnetIDOfTheDevice.30-DeviceAddress/hostID

**Class of IP Addresses:** (range) - for network Addresses
A  - 0 to 127
B - 128 to 191
C - 192 to 223
D - 224 to 239
E - 239 to 255

A - 0 .0 .0 .0 -  127.255.255.255
B - 128. 0. 0. 0 - 191 .255 .255 .255
C - 192 .0 .0 .0 - 223. 255 .255 .255
D - 224 .0 .0 .0 - 239. 255 .255 .255
E - 240 .0 .0 .0 - 255. 255. 255 .255
- subnetting..

**Subnet Masking:** (as we segregate and structure of IP matters to network or individual devices) - the process of masking the range of IP's as network and devices separately which helps us use the host part in order to work with its subsidies.

if i take 255.255.0.0, i can add any number here which can be given to devices
there will be variable subn

**variable length subnet:** can set own length of subnets, example: CIDR Blocks
12.0.0.0/31 - here, telling that first 31bits are for my subnet. rest is rest.
eg: 192.0.1.0/24 - in total, i have 32bits. 24 are for subnet, remaining 8. 
start to end of the IP - 192.0.1.0 - 192.0.1.055 - 255IP's - how do we allocate it to IP Addresses? how does that?  - 

IETF.org does this. Not by classes but by regions as this
Reserved Addresses:
127.0.0.0/8
Loopback addresses: localhost 127.0.0.1

#### IPV4 vs IPV6
![[CN41.png]]
Packets: Header=20bytes
**IPv4**: 2^34
IPv, Length, ID, Flags, Protocols, Checksums, Addresses. TTL(TimeToLive) etc..
ping url - ttl after that much hops, will be dropped and packet gets lost.

**IPv6**: 4X larger than IPv4. s32^4 = 2^128 = 3.4*10^38
cons: Not compatible, shift issue, lot of hardware work and more
structure: hexadecimal on each .
prefixes can be done here too for the IPv6 too.

#### Middle Boxes
![[CN42.png]]
Middle Boxes: Middlewares
extra devices that also interacts with the transport layer. refer the above diagram.
eg: Firewall, 

Firewalll - filters on required metrics, set flasgs, set ports, rules, protocols and such. S

Stateless and statefull - loose vs verfice cache and does its dut - between host and network

#### (NAT) Network Address Translation
VIDEO: <-> wikipedia
Why NAT? slows the consumption of IP's
there are types of NAT's for different usecase, pros and cons, methods and more.
research further..
#### TCP (Data Link Layer)
Send Last layer - Data link layer
over a physical link - Router. DHCP and to the devices. 
![[CN39.png]]

ARP + FRAMES+ DHCP IP's gave by the router and its destination..
