## EARLIER STAGES - Baseline:
**6 Month Course @QSpiders**
Course Review/Feedback: **Trash, In-effective**
##### Syllabus given below the actual roadmap

-------------------------------------
## Hexr Factory - Training

#### Summary:

Fresher but done a Full stack Software Testing Course - 36K @QSpiders Training Institute. Very little knowledge on Java, SQL(RDBMS), Manual and automatic testing, SDLC, STLC, Types of software testing, Testcase Design (SBS rule, ECP, BVA), Report Generation, management using JIRA, Presentation and Communication. 
Automation Testing - Overview, Types and Areas (functionality, e2e, api and more) of testing, Testing tools, Selenium basics and workings overview, TestNG (framework, workings, applications, before and after viz, report extraction)
