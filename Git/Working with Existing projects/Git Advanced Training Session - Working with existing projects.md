Previously we have conducted a training on - Introduction to Git.

Where we have covered (more of an introductory like session of Git), topic such as,
- What is Version control
- What is Git
- Git Architecture
- Local Repo
- Staging Area
- Remote Repo
- Working between local and remote repo
- What are commits
- What are branches
- Working with branches
- All the `git` commands, the essentials that are relevant to what we have covered
- and much more
These has been more personal working with projects all by themselves an such.  But

## Git Advanced - Working with existing projects

##### Options to be in sync with existing projects
###### **Key Concepts**
1) **Forking**
- Forking means creating a copy of an existing repo in your SCM.
- This allows you to freely modify and experiment with the project without affecting the original repo.
Eg: 
- original:  `http://185.100.212.76:7776/Dwinzo-Beta/Dwinzo_dev.git`, 
- forked: `http://185.100.212.76:7776/Dwinzo-Beta/Dwinzo_dev.git`

To **Synchronize changes** (Local) - In sync of your local repo with the remote repo 
2) **Fetch:**
```
git fetch
```
Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches.
3) **merge:**
```
git merge
```
Combines remote tracking branch into current local branch 
4) **Push:**
```
git push 
```
Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub 
5) **Pull:**
```
git pull 
```
Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge

6) **Pulling from Upstream**
Before that, `pull` Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge

Here in the upstream project, - The upstream repo is the original repo from which you forked. Since the upstream repo continues to evolve (as other contributors make changes), you need to keep your fork updated. 
Command to sync your fork with the latest upstream changes,
```
# Add upstream (only once)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/org/repo.git  

# Fetch changes
git fetch upstream                                       
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main                                        
# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main                                  
# Push to your fork
git push origin main
```

After doing this, In the original repo, 
7) **Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR)**
- After making changes in your fork, you propose merging them back into the original (upstream) repository.
- **GitHub calls it a Pull Request (PR)**, while **GitLab calls it a Merge Request (MR)**.
- PR/MR helps maintainers review your code before accepting it.****

To **Synchronize changes** (Remote and Parent repo) Contribute to an Existing Project
After merging, sync your fork to avoid conflicts:
```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

###### Steps to Contribute to an Existing Project
**Step 1: Fork the Repository**
- Go to the GitHub/GitLab repository and click **Fork**.
- This creates a copy under your account.

 **Step 2: Clone Your Fork**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo.git
cd repo
```

**Step 3: Set Upstream Remote**
- Add the original repository as an **upstream** remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/org/repo.git
git remote -v  # Verify remotes
```

**Step 4: Create a New Branch for Your Work**
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

**Step 5: Make Your Changes and Commit**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added a new feature"
```

**Step 6: Push Changes to Your Fork**
```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

**Step 7: Open a Pull Request (PR)**
- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Click **"Compare & pull request"**.
- Add a title and description, and submit the PR.

**Step 8: Review and Merge**
- Wait for maintainers to review your PR.
- If approved, the changes get merged.
- If changes are requested, update your PR accordingly.

**Step 9: Sync with Upstream**
- After merging, sync your fork to avoid conflicts:
```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

**Best Practices**
‚úÖ Keep your fork updated by regularly fetching upstream changes.  
‚úÖ Create feature branches instead of working directly on `main`.  
‚úÖ Write meaningful commit messages.  
‚úÖ Follow the repository‚Äôs contribution guidelines.  
‚úÖ Engage in PR discussions and resolve feedback.

By following these steps, you can efficiently contribute to open-source projects or collaborate on shared repositories. üöÄ

## **Handling Merge Conflicts in Git**
When working with Git, merge conflicts occur when two commits modify the same part of a file, and Git cannot automatically resolve the differences. Resolving merge conflicts properly ensures smooth collaboration and project integrity.

**1. Types of Merge Conflicts**
1. **Local Conflicts** - Occur when merging branches in your local repository.
2. **Remote Conflicts** - Occur when pushing to a remote repository but conflicting changes exist.
3. **Upstream Conflicts** - Happen when your changes conflict with updates made in the original (upstream) repository.

**2. Resolving Merge Conflicts Locally**
When you pull changes from `upstream` or merge branches, you might see:
```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <filename>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

**Step 1: Identify Conflicted Files**
Run:
```bash
git status
```
It will show files with conflicts.

**Step 2: Manually Resolve Conflicts**
Open the conflicting file in an editor. You‚Äôll see:
```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes here
=======
Upstream or branch changes here
>>>>>>> branch-name
```
- Keep the desired changes and remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
- Example of a resolved file:
```Text
Final merged content with necessary changes.
```

**Step 3: Mark the Conflict as Resolved**
```bash
git add <filename>
```

**Step 4: Complete the Merge**
```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in <filename>"
```

**Step 5: Push the Changes**

```bash
git push origin <branch>
```

## **Resolving Merge Conflicts While Pushing to a Remote Repository**
If you try pushing changes and see:
```
error: failed to push some refs to 'origin'
```
It means someone else pushed conflicting changes.

**Step 1: Fetch and Rebase**
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```
- If conflicts occur, manually resolve them as in Step 2 above.
- Continue the rebase:
```bash
git rebase --continue
```
- Push the resolved branch:
```bash
git push origin <branch> --force
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Use `--force` carefully**, as it overwrites history.

## **Resolving Merge Conflicts with Upstream**
When syncing with an upstream repository, conflicts may arise.

**Step 1: Fetch Upstream**
```bash
git fetch upstream
```

 **Step 2: Merge Upstream Changes**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```
- If conflicts occur, resolve them manually.
- Commit and push the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts from upstream"
git push origin main
```

### **Rebase Instead of Merge (Alternative)**
For a cleaner history:
```bash
git rebase upstream/main
```
- Resolve conflicts if any, then:
```bash
git rebase --continue
git push origin main --force
```

**Best Practices for Avoiding Merge Conflicts**
‚úÖ **Pull changes regularly** (`git pull --rebase origin main`).  
‚úÖ **Work in feature branches**, not directly on `main`.  
‚úÖ **Commit frequently and in small chunks** to minimize conflicts.  
‚úÖ **Use meaningful commit messages** to explain changes clearly.  
‚úÖ **Always review PRs before merging** to catch potential conflicts early.  
‚úÖ **Use `git stash` before pulling** if you have local uncommitted changes:
```bash
git stash
git pull --rebase upstream main
git stash pop
```
By following these practices, you can efficiently handle and prevent merge conflicts in Git. üöÄ

### RECAP with some extra fresh content: (using  [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/))

##### Welcome to Learn Git Branching  [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

Interested in learning Git? Well you've come to the right place! "Learn Git Branching" is the most visual and interactive way to learn Git on the web; you'll be challenged with exciting levels, given step-by-step demonstrations of powerful features, and maybe even have a bit of fun along the way.

After this dialog you'll see the variety of levels we have to offer. If you're a beginner, just go ahead and start with the first. If you already know some Git basics, try some of our later more challenging levels.

You can see all the commands available with¬†`show commands`¬†at the terminal.

PS: Want to go straight to a sandbox next time? Try out¬†[this special link](https://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?NODEMO)

PPS: GitHub has started naming the default branch¬†`main`¬†instead of¬†`master`¬†to migrate away from biased terminology¬†[(more details available here)](https://github.com/github/renaming). In accordance with this industry-wide movement, we have also updated "Learn Git Branching" to use¬†`main`¬†instead of¬†`master`¬†in our lessons. This rename should be fairly consistent by now but if you notice any errors, feel free to submit a PR (or open an issue).

## MAIN / LOCAL / PERSONAL

### Introduction Sequence
A nicely paced introduction to the majority of git commands

**1: Introduction to Git Commits**
## Git Commits
A commit in a git repo records a snapshot of all the (tracked) files in your directory. It's like a giant copy and paste, but even better!

Git wants to keep commits as lightweight as possible though, so it doesn't just blindly copy the entire directory every time you commit. It can (when possible) compress a commit as a set of changes, or a "delta", from one version of the repo to the next.

Git also maintains a history of which commits were made when. That's why most commits have ancestor commits above them -- we designate this with arrows in our visualization. Maintaining history is great for everyone working on the project!

It's a lot to take in, but for now you can think of commits as snapshots of the project. Commits are very lightweight and switching between them is wicked fast!

Let's see what this looks like in practice. On the right we have a visualization of a (small) git repo. There are two commits right now -- the first initial commit,¬†`C0`, and one commit after that¬†`C1`¬†that might have some meaningful changes.

Hit the button below to make a new commit.

```
git commit
```
it just commits.

There we go! Awesome. We just made changes to the repo and saved them as a commit. The commit we just made has a parent,¬†`C1`, which references which commit it was based off of.

## Git Branches

Branches in Git are incredibly lightweight as well. They are simply pointers to a specific commit -- nothing more. This is why many Git enthusiasts chant the mantra:

==**branch early, and branch often**==

Because there is no storage / memory overhead with making many branches, it's easier to logically divide up your work than have big beefy branches.

When we start mixing branches and commits, we will see how these two features combine. For now though, just remember that a branch essentially says "I want to include the work of this commit and all parent commits."

Let's see what branches look like in practice. Here we will create a new branch named¬†`newImage`.

```
git branch newImage
```

There, that's all there is to branching! The branch¬†`newImage`¬†now refers to commit¬†`C1`.

Let's try to put some work on this new branch. Hit the button below.
```
git commit
```

Oh no! The¬†`main`¬†branch moved but the¬†`newImage`¬†branch didn't! That's because we weren't "on" the new branch, which is why the asterisk (*) was on¬†`main`.

Let's tell git we want to checkout the branch with

```
git checkout <name>
```

This will put us on the new branch before committing our changes.

```
git checkout newImage
;
git commit
```
There we go! Our changes were recorded on the new branch.

>   **Note**: In Git version 2.23, a new command called¬†`git switch`¬†was introduced to eventually replace¬†`git checkout`, which is somewhat overloaded (it does a bunch of different things depending on the arguments). The lessons here will still use¬†`checkout`¬†instead of¬†`switch`¬†because the¬†`switch`¬†command is still considered experimental and the syntax may change in the future. However you can still try out the new¬†`switch`¬†command in this application, and also¬†[learn more here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch)._

Ok! You are all ready to get branching. Once this window closes, make a new branch named¬†`bugFix`¬†and switch to that branch.

By the way, here's a shortcut: if you want to create a new branch AND check it out at the same time, you can simply type¬†`git checkout -b [yourbranchname]`.

> Would you like to move on to¬†_"Merging in Git"_, the next level?


## Branches and Merging

Great! We now know how to commit and branch. Now we need to learn some kind of way of combining the work from two different branches together. This will allow us to branch off, develop a new feature, and then combine it back in.

The first method to combine work that we will examine is¬†`git merge`. Merging in Git creates a special commit that has two unique parents. A commit with two parents essentially means "I want to include all the work from this parent over here and this one over here,¬†_and_¬†the set of all their parents."

It's easier with visuals, let's check it out in the next view.

Here we have two branches; each has one commit that's unique. This means that neither branch includes the entire set of "work" in the repo that we have done. Let's fix that with merge.

We will¬†`merge`¬†the branch¬†`bugFix`¬†into¬†`main`.
```
git merge bugFix
```

Woah! See that? First of all,¬†`main`¬†now points to a commit that has two parents. If you follow the arrows up the commit tree from¬†`main`, you will hit every commit along the way to the root. This means that¬†`main`¬†contains all the work in the repo now.

Also, see how the colors of the commits changed? To help with learning, I have included some color coordination. Each branch has a unique color. Each commit turns a color that is the blended combination of all the branches that contain that commit.

So here we see that the¬†`main`¬†branch color is blended into all the commits, but the¬†`bugFix`¬†color is not. Let's fix that...

Let's merge¬†`main`¬†into¬†`bugFix`:
```
git checkout bugFix; git merge main
```

Since¬†`bugFix`¬†was an ancestor of¬†`main`, git didn't have to do any work; it simply just moved¬†`bugFix`¬†to the same commit¬†`main`¬†was attached to.

Now all the commits are the same color, which means each branch contains all the work in the repo! Woohoo!

To complete this level, do the following steps:
- Make a new branch called¬†`bugFix`
- Checkout the¬†`bugFix`¬†branch with¬†`git checkout bugFix`
- Commit once
- Go back to¬†`main`¬†with¬†`git checkout`
- Commit another time
- Merge the branch¬†`bugFix`¬†into¬†`main`¬†with¬†`git merge`

_Remember, you can always re-display this dialog with "objective"!_
