### Work Experience
DevOps/IT Engineer, @ HEXR FACTORY IMMERSIVE TECH,
Jan 2024 - Present,
Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India 

End-to-end ownership of hybrid (cloud/on-prem/air-gapped) infrastructure supporting **HPC workloads** (digital twins, XR/3 D platforms) and **resource-constrained Edge/IoT** deployments.

Sole DevOps operator with end-to-end ownership of the IT infrastructure with hybrid (Cloud, bare-metal and air-gapped) environments - architecting, provisioning, and maintaining tools and resources for diverse workloads - **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** workloads like digital twins and XR/3D platforms and **Lightweight, resource-constrained workloads** for remote IoT and Edge cases 

1) Infrastructure Management: ==Administrated **13+ nodes highly available Kubernetes clusters** (kubeadm for HPC workloads; k 3 s for resource-constrained IoT/Edge cases) across diverse environments replacing manual but fragile and grunty Docker deployments 


2)  Systems  and Resources Provisioning:  ==Transitioned from manual one-on-one mundane setting up systems to Automated provisioning  of resources using IaC such as compute, networking, storage, services (self-hosted and managed), internal tooling, and dev environments across teams.==

3) - CI/CD, GitOps and Automation: ==Replaced manual and broken dev workflows into a **robust and automated build jobs, CI/CD and GitOps-driven pipeline with DevSecOps**, increasing deployments from 1–2/day to **continuous delivery**  with secure, failsafe, rapid zero-downtime rollbacks and rollouts without compromising safety or compliance. ==

4) Observability: ==Enhanced end-to-end visibility on real-time and performance on apps, systems, databases, networks IOPs  metrics, improved scopes, slashed attack surface and cloud costs **without sacrificing performance or security**, while delivering actionable insights for R&D and optimization using comprehensive observability stack. ==

5) SecOps (Security): ==Enforced **Shift-Left/Shift-Down, Zero Trust security approach to the entire SDLC** - mandated clean code complied to **bottom-up approach**, distroless containers (zero to less CVEs), pre-commit hooks, integrated **SAST/DAST/SCA with SBOM analysis** turning little to no consideration for security to **hardened, actionable and auditable landscape**. ==

6) Leadership and Collaboration:  ==Led cross-functional teams and mentored an SDET, with SRE Principles (keeping up with SLIs/SLOs with less or no toils), agile, clean code and developer accountability across distributed teams fostering collaboration, smoothen workflows and driving reliability-focused improvements on entire SDLC.==
