in this video I'm going to continue

processing my notes that I took on this

book so far using the ttle Casten method

and this time I'm going to be using my

neovim workflow so if I open up my daily

note then we see here the these are the

links that I created earlier and now I

can just continue uh here and I did this

by running the ZK day command this is a

CLI that I wrote myself it has a few

options that I did and you can find the

source code on my GitHub it's called

ttle cast and CLI you can use it if you

want but it's very bespoke for my own

system but I also have this command

called ZK new and I'm I'm now going to

move towards symbolic and Subs symbolic

AI so I'm just going to create a note

called ZK

new symbolic

AI this is going to create a note in my

inbox with the title symbolic Ai and

then it adds that to my um and then it

adds the markdown heading as well and if

I close this

now and if I open my daily note again we

see that it has added this note to the

bottom there so that is why I like

to um this is why I use this CLI so I

can create notes from the C from the

command line and that it's automatically

added to my daily notes so I can keep

track of when I created them so if I

open up this note again symbolic Ai and

here's the the text that I that I typed

down

okay so symbolic AI uses symbols and

relations between them to solve problems

so it uses language if I'm not mistaken

and the counterpart of this

is sub

symbolic sub symbolic

Ai and Subs symbolic

AI is inspired

by

biological

brains using feedback to train AI

okay so this subsymbolic AI is the

opposite of symbolic Ai and Subs

symbolic in AI is inspired by biological

brains so rather than using symbols

you're actually using data and using

feedback to Train II to learn to

recognize written numbers for example

that's the example that she uses in the

book um here maybe I

should maybe I can find find that in the

PDF as well here this is the example

that she uses so this is um

a Subs symbolic AI is used for pattern

recognition and then we're going to go

into the perceptor on definition

afterwards but the idea is that a Subs

symbolic AI is able to take an image

like this and then learn how to

recognize the number eight that's an

example of Subs symbolic

AI so

learning to perform

simple

perceptual

tasks and the key idea is that it's

inspired by biological brains so um in

the next concept that's important to to

understand here is

then um the perceptron

and then if I now run space

ZN it will create and open this note in

my ttle Casten system using the CLI and

it should have also added that to my

daily notes let me see yes here we go

it's also added to my daily notes so I'm

just

demonstrating how I can use this CLI

from within neovim as well this is why

you should learn back and Linux well so

you can do these things for yourself

instead of relying on other people's

plugins that you don't really understand

so now I have the perceptron Note coming

from the subs symbolic AI note and a

perceptron is if I check out my

notes mimics a

neuron several

impulses that will fire if a threshold

is

reached so what is meant by that is that

um this is basically a

perceptron and it is mimicked by a

neuron so in your your

um your neurons in your brain they have

dendrites which are inputs and then the

Exxon the output is whether that neuron

will fire or not so if you have a

certain type of input coming in and if

the sum is then at a certain threshold

the neuron will fire and a perceptron is

the same so in the case of recognizing

an

eight then uh these grids have a

numerical

representation and if the sum of that

input then is uh at a certain threshold

then it is likely that it's a number

eight and by doing that over and over

again then you can Benchmark the the

weights of these perceptrons and when

you link a bunch of perceptrons together

then you create something uh that's

called a neural network

and that's going to be the next note

that I have

so I mean this is already getting a bit

deeper than I initially thought that I

would go I mean I'm I'm still just

wrapping my mind around the definition

of artificial intelligence and what it

is and what it does but I do think it is

useful to learn about sub symbolic and

symbolic

Ai and it's a very important fact that

this is the sub symbol IC AI approach is

inspired by the biological brains and

therefore has a more call it

organic uh

learning

approach yeah

um uses a more

organic learning approach uh

using several

iterations of training and adjusting the

perceptron

waits

to get more accurate

results and again these are all my words

this is

just this is just my words my thinking

in this note and which I then can later

use for example in an essay so let's

open symbolic AI again use the symbols

and relations between them to solve

problems and now I wonder is symbolic AI

than are large language models than a

form of symbolic AI so I'm going to go

to

claw and I'm going to create a new chat

so um symbolic

Ai and then Subs symbolic

AI I'm

studying AI using using settle cast

method I wrote these

notes is this uh a correct way of

phrasing it so as you see I like to

verify with claw if what I'm writing

down is actually correct especially

because I'm a content creator so it's

very important that I sort of fact check

the knowledge that I put out there and

then also um is it correct

correct uh according to

these

definitions uh it seems that

llms fall under the

symbolic AI category is that correct

okay so llms do fall under the subs

symbolic AI category so that's

interesting because I um initially

thought it would be symbolic and it's

good that I fact check this so let's see

if I can this helps me understand more

so symbolic works with explicit rules in

symbolic

manipulation uses human readable symbols

and logical

rules okay

yeah reasoning process trans transparent

and can be followed step by step ah okay

yeah that's a key difference

because nobody really knows how llms

work I mean they are trained but you

can't

actually um understand the

decisionmaking process because it is um

abstracted away from human

language it's more like following a

flowchart or a decision

tree and then Subs symbolic works with p

patterns and statistical relationships

learns from

data yeah uses distributive weight

representations reasoning process is

often opaque black box is what I meant

to say

earlier so it is

correct okay so that gives me some more

insights so I'm going to expand my

symbolic AI note with uh it it does tie

into related to algorithms so

symbolic AI uses transparent reasoning

and human language it's more like a flow

chart Claude described it as traditional

AI okay

and um decision trees rule based systems

transparent and can be followed step by

step that's an important

one can be followed step by

step it's more like it's more like a

flow

chart called described it as traditional

Ai and then Subs symbolic AIS

so then I have a note that will say

llms fall into the sub symbolic AI

category creating a new note about

this

and the reason why is because llms learn

patterns from training data

rather than following explicit rules

they use neuron

networks okay so everything that uses a

neural network is Subs symbolic AI

That's an important idea

here

[Music]

so anything that uses a neural

network is a sub symbolic AI

okay and sometimes that is just the note

sometimes the my notes are just the

titles so let me just verify this with

Claud is this correct

then it's a bit more nuanced okay

while neural networks are primary

example of sub symbolic a distinction

between symbolic and sub symbolic is

more about the approach to processing

information rather than the specific

technology used

okay well I'm happy with this I think

this is clear for my thinking so I'm

going to just keep that in okay so that

can go llms fall into the subs symbolic

AI category that I also don't need to

expand that a bit more well maybe I

could write

um let me see why do they fall into that

because they learn patterns from

draining

data yeah

and they use neural

networks adjust weights and don't

manipulate

symbols okay so rather than using

symbols they use statistical patterns

okay so those are my definitions of

symbolic and subsymbolic

AI I have my definition of a perceptron

and again I'm just I'm currently just

interested in definitions and not going

too deep into all of the details about

everything even though I just

did so those are a few else that I

processed now let me see is

there anything that I want

to now I change to my next notebook

here and now I go into neural networks

so that's an interesting

definition um that I also want to add

here but I don't have to add it here so

it's just going to be a a new note I

suppose CK

new um neural

networks so my neural networks note has

this in it

okay so this goes into more about how

neural networks actually uh produce

results so let me just finish writing

what I have

here okay yeah so this note I wrote

about neural NE networks is basically

going into the inner workings of neuron

networks they're collection of

perceptrons and let me just add that to

my can

I um add word to spell list G okay so

collection of perceptions but instead of

01 they compute a value between zero and

one called activation yeah so these are

my own words but but if I search for

Activation

here let me

see yeah so here this um this is

basically what it means

that if the sum that a unit Compu is low

the units activation is close to zero if

the sum is high the activation is close

to

one so instead of the

neuron that

we

um that we used

earlier let me

see

MH e

yeah so in this in this

image this is the input then the hidden

layer which is the term that I

defined

um no I didn't Define it but I don't

think I need to for my own studies but

the idea is that this hidden layer then

computes several

outputs and every output layer so each

of these layers get a um number so it's

going to be if if you take zero to one

it's probably a a 0.9 confidence that it

point six confidence that it a zero but

it's a point

uh 0.01 confidence that it is a two for

example because it's very different so

all of these are going to have a number

between zero and one and then eight is

going to be the highest and that

activation of that eth layer is then

going to be um a another output of this

network and then from that you can

deduce which one has the highest number

and therefore this image is is most

likely to be an eight and this is what a

neural network is it has several

layers of um perceptrons perceptron like

simulated

neurons and they take the input process

them then output a digit and these

digits are then processed in order to

come to a confidence level of confidence

of the

output so that is called activation all

of the layers lead to Output layers and

the one with the highest activation

wins this is known as classification so

the classification of this image is

going to be

eight it's hard to know

beforehand be how many layers are needed

it's usually trial and

error

so it's actually comes later I think

that's more

logical so this is called

a hidden layer but this can be more

layers there can be it maybe there's a

layer to process the top half and then

the bottom half and then one that

combines it and the more layers there

are the deeper the neural

network so that is why you can refer to

networks as having

depth and again it's hard to know how

many layers are needed usually trial and

error so so basically the definition

here is the colle a neuron network is a

collection of

perceptrons and rather than just true or

false they output numbers and that's

basically all I need to know um for my

current stage of of understanding so I

can then cross out this

note and then next my my next note that

I have is

machine

learning so do I already

have let me

see no I don't have a a different note

about machine learning yet so maybe I

will just uh create a node called

machine

learning seek a new machine

learning and I know this one is related

to machine

learning so why is it not opening my

[Music]

markdown

links

yeah okay so I want to link it to that

note

and here we go now it's thinking okay

machine learning is a branch of AI where

machines learn from their own data or

experiences that was one note that I

already

wrote the next one or this note actually

contains the following text

so I really like this definition

algorithms that enable computers to

learn from

data so yeah I mean this node basically

says something

similar and it contains

this uh thing that we wrote in Claude so

I kind of like this I I will keep that

around but this is going to be my Mach

machine learning main

note and I wrote this in my own words

because I remember I remember writing

this and I don't need to refine this

more this is my own definition that I

did jued from the book so I'm going to

keep this uh like this

then the next node is called General

Ai and here I wrote

okay so this note um this definition is

about General AI another definition that

I wanted to yeah lock down an AI That's

equal or better than human intelligence

in most ways also known as AGI so that's

another definition I wanted to lock down

and the and that is basically uh the end

of the noes that I have so far so now

now I

have all of these notes on my daily note

currently but I want to also have I also

need to add these to

the book note that I had so

here I can

just yank all of these because they all

came from

the same note so I can just paste these

in and then what I do is

I

um prean that with a let me see contrl

V okay so now everything has a button in

front of it okay so these are all notes

that are coming from this one

book and then there are a couple of

links that I want to make but this is

basically what you see me doing now is

just the writing process and getting it

down into Vim because I really like

switching Windows using vim and such

like but usually the the linking itself

I would do from obsidian so symbolic Ai

and Subs symbolic AI are definitely

related so I will link this to sub

symbolic

AI then

and this one had the perceptron link

already so there are already a few links

there that's good uh LMS fall into the

subs symbolic AI category well that one

has a

backlink from this one so that's

fine neural anything I use in neural

network yes okay so everything that's

linked I'm just going to move straight

to my settle cast because all of these

notes end up in my inbox you see here

here's my

inbox and now I can just start moving

those to my settle cast as I go along so

move this to T

Casten and this can be moved because

it's

linked perceptron is

linked moving

that this one is

linked um this one is linked

neural networks this one also has

links and this can be linked to deep

learning or deep neural networks but I

think this is fine for now so I can just

move that to the set of cast as well

Machine

learning that one I want to have on my

main artificial intelligence

note here

machine

learning and this one can go because I

already linked to the machine learning

node and then I want to have symbolic

Ai and Subs symbolic AI

here okay that's basically the

definitions that I am most interested in

and then the

perceptron definition is linked here so

if I need it then I will naturally end

up there and then finally General AI is

also an important definition

so

uh that one I also want to have

here General AI so so now I have

processed a bunch of what we call

fleeting notes from my notebook here and

now they are in my system so I actually

uh cross these out I just I just take my

pencil and cross these out so I know

that these are actually processed and in

my system they are all linked and and

added to my tle cast now in the next one

that I would like to do is that

I um am going to since I'm building this

sort of Mind map about AI in my mind now

I'm going to be actually drawing this

out using using excal draw and that's

going to be the subject of the next

video so let me know if you like this if

you're into note taking you should

definitely check out my free community

it's all about no taking I have tons of

courses on obsidian and how to use the C

Castle method check it out I think you

might like it see you in the next one
