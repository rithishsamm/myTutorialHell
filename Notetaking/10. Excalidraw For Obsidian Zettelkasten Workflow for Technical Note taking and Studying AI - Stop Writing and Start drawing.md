in this video I'm going to continue

processing the notes from this book

artificial intelligence a guide for

thinking humans and in the previous

videos I've created a bunch of notes

about the definition of AI and machine

learning and such like and what I also

like to do is to implement visual

learning in my system so I am not a very

visual person by definition and that's

why like drawing mind maps and Inc

incorporating image in my not taking

system is has been proven to be very

helpful and that's what I'm going to be

doing today so I I have this note here

that I didn't show in the previous

videos but this is basically what

sparked this journey I wanted to know

more about the AI fundamentals and here

I had a several questions that I wanted

to answer and then I asked and I was

recommended this book by a AI friend of

mine a real friend who specializes in Ai

and most of these questions have already

been answered from that book so it was a

very good recommendation so from this

note I created this AI fundamentals

drawing which is completely empty but I

say this because I'm going to call this

the the middle node of this mind map is

going to be AI fundamental so it's going

to be definitions and basic yeah the the

fundamentals of AI that that I want to

explore

so following this structure there is

singularity and a definition of

artificial intelligence AI so there are

def different several things that I want

to do here so now I'm going to think

about do I want to have a node that's

called

definitions and am I going to then

expand this mind map later or am I take

going

to um basically take this as a

definitions mind map let me

think

um yeah I think I've decided that I'm

not going to call it AI fundamentals I'm

going to call it AI

definitions and then I can create a

later I create can create one that's

called AI fundamentals if I want to um

but this actually the most important

thing is that

I uh AI definitions that I process these

definition notes that I have created so

far so let's start with the definition

of artificial

intelligence so here we have the note

artificial intelligence we have this uh

big note that has that contains the

information and what I like to do is I

will then um let's see insert any file

artificial

intelligence and here is this not

Definition of artificial intelligence

and then I like to embed that as an

image like

this so then I have the text in um in

this lovely excal font and then I can

use this as a base and I can then add

some imagery here if I want to but the

it was invented by

um McCarthy in

1956 so then I will some of the things

that are important here is that

first

defined in

1956 um by it was by

McCarthy um and then I like this a

branch of computer science

that studies the properties of

intelligence by synthesizing

intelligence so let me just open up this

note

and let's

just add this

here oops

okay so this is the the text now a

branch of computer science that

studies

okay a branch of computer s science that

studies the properties of

intelligence by synthesizing

intelligence maybe I like

to I like how this visually breaks down

into bits here so it's first defined

here a branch of computer science yes

and then later I have a smaller

definition and let me

see okay so this these two blocks are

basically a definition so I will just

add a node called

definition here

and then artificial intelligence

also breaks down in this symbolic and

subsymbolic AI right that's what we have

over here symbolic Ai and subsymbolic

AI so here I would

then make another one which is

called uh types of AI

and then here I would then

add

symbolic and sub

symbolic okay so this note I'm not sure

if I'm going to keep that

here maybe it can be here like to have

it what I'm basically doing is I'm

creating a visual essay I really like to

do

that so here it's very clear now what

the definition is and where it came

from let's do this by

McCarthy like that by

McCarthy and here the definition is

clear now I have types of AI symbolic Ai

and Subs symbolic AI now here I could

insert

this let me see Subs symbolic

AI as

image then it's clear and then I can do

another

image symbolic

AI as image so

here I can actually

just remove

these and then if I want to explore

symbolic and Subs symbolic AI I have my

nodes directly over

here so that is really nice that means

that I can

basically visually explore the

definitions of these art types of

artificial

intelligence so I have done now I have a

bit of an overview of what I want but

the next one is the next definition is

going to be machine

learning but related to these two there

are a few more notes so let's first

deepen those a bit more so symbolic

AI leads to Subs symbolic Ai and Subs

symbolic AI leads to

perceptron so with the

perceptron that should definitely be

link to this so here I should

have I don't know if I should have the

file let me see what does it look like

perceptron here well it looks pretty

cool but then now I have basically have

this the basic structure going now I I

like to add some imagery well first I'm

going to add some color so I'm going

to uh use

this marker and I will then I like to

start with the blue one in this case

start with the thickest

one no I want the other one so this

one

yeah like that then I'm going to draw

some more branches here

definition andp types of

AI and then these Branch out to this and

this and all of this branches and all of

this is related to this image over here

so I like to have that

here now types of

AI is going to

be branching to symbolic Ai

and that one I should use a different

marker here

this

[Music]

one and this one and this leads to this

one all right so this is already looking

quite visually pleasing now what I like

to do is I like to add some images so

for Subs symbolic AI we have this

perceptron and for that we have a neuron

so I will go to Google images and I'm

just going to add a neuron

image feel free to join my community I

have courses on no taking and we are all

geeking out on learning techniques and

studying if you want to become a better

engineer you should definitely join this

and if you can't afford it there is the

free

community no questions asked you can

just add you can just join and interact

with people and make new

friends okay so after a bit of searching

I've now found a an image that I quite

like which then represents the

perceptron in this case so this looks

pretty good I like this this is just a

bit of extra visual um imagery here and

then symbolic AI this actually reminds

me of a um cover from the band death

metal

or for from The Band Called

Death let me see

that's death

symbolic yeah this is a really

interesting image and I think I'm just

going

to take this image and use

that because I like it it it's a bit

fun it's a cover of

a an of um a favorite death metal band

of mine death

symbolic but I can use this to

remember better because perceptron is a

neuron in my mind now now I link this to

the brain this is how I remember that

Subs symbolic AI is inspired by

biological brains now symbolic

AI uh is more logical it has more

reasoning so I just have to figure out

in a

relationship why why symbolic AI is

actually related to this image but that

is the reason why I do it like this

and um I I like that there's an i in the

Co in the cover here so symbolic AI has

an ey

and uses transparent reasoning and human

language so death symbolic is created by

a human Chuck schuer who died recently

or who die very young so that's the way

I can remember this but just by engaging

with this material in a visual way like

this it is now being lodged into my mind

it's much clearer now so now I have done

my artificial intelligence

definition now I can look more into

machine learning I have a couple of

definitions for machine learning as

well so um machine learning here is

algorithms that enable computers to

learn from

data and that is a very nice and concise

definition so let's see let's add

machine learning

here machine learning and I'm going to

make that

orange like this and machine learning

and I'm going to

then maybe add this file machine

learning and we had the

[Music]

file here machine learning is a branch

of AI where machines learn from their

own data or experiences

now like I'm just in the process of

learning here I'm just creating this as

I go along but as I create these mind

maps they are very likely to

change so I know that I'm going to be

interested more in machine learning in

the future so this case I'm actually

going to ex leave some room for

expansion here because I know that I'm

going to be learning more about machine

learning because about training models

and things like that so I'm deliberately

keeping some more space here but for now

I have the definition machine learning

algorithms that enable computers to

learn from data it's a branch of

AI where machines learn from their own

data or experiences and this one has

this elaboration about um what learning

actually is and maybe I should have a

definition of learning and intelligence

in this for

example like I have artificial

intelligence and machine learning but

maybe I should actually have a section

on

intelligence and learning as

well

so what is

learning actually

and what

is

intelligence and then I could have like

a human sense so maybe

human and then

machine so what does it mean for a for a

machine to be intelligent because the

def definition here is machine learning

algorithm that enable to computers to

learn from their own data

well maybe actually this should be down

here and maybe you start seeing now how

manipulating these things visually can

be so powerful because I'm sparking

these questions for myself now as I'm

engaging with these words and arranging

them on a white on a board like this and

playing with the ideas and I'm moving

things around and now I I actually know

I realize that okay we're going into

machine learning but I don't even know

what learning actually means so I could

have a learning section here which is

then related to this one for example and

I can make these connections between

there what is intelligence well maybe

intelligence is more related to this one

so maybe this note should just go on

intelligence and this is more about

learning

Etc so what what is

intelligence and then what is learning

so I think this is a good the good way

to spread them out I have learning with

machine learning and artif intelligence

with artificial

intelligence and this is B basically how

I go about using excal draw in yeah

going deeper into this and as I work

through this through these Concepts and

as I go along I identify gaps in my

knowledge like I did now I like I should

Define what learning is before I even go

into art in machine

learning and the result is that I have

this mind map now that I can then use as

a YouTube video I can then start here

with AI definitions and I can use this

as a journey to go through and then I

can just take this as a visual essay and

talk about what I've learned and share

these things in a visually pleasing way

and not only is this a nice way of

presenting it's much nicer than just uh

PowerPoint slides but the process of

creating this helps me to learn so much

more and so much deeper and so much

better and this is how I learn much

faster than other people even though you

might even though you see that I spend a

lot of time doing this

but when I do it I do it in I I learn

more much more deeper because I'm

interacting with it visually and this is

why these tools are so helpful because I

am not a visual person I I'm not a an

artist I'm very bad at drawing but I do

like to arrange things visually and this

is a skill that I've learned over time

and it really helps me in my thinking
