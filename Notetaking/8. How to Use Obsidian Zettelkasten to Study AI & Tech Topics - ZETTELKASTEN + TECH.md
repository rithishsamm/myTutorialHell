the number one comment I get on my note

taking videos is comments asking me to

show how I actually do this how do I

create settle cast notes how do I

Implement them into my system so in this

video I'm going to take a practical

example I'm currently studying

artificial intelligence and I'm reading

this book and I am going to be

processing my notes that I took while

reading this book so I'm going to take

my time for this I'm going to show you

exactly how I do it and how slowly I how

slowly I do it so this is your chance to

get a sneak peek behind the scenes of

what actually goes on in Misha's tcas

and system which now contains 4,000

notes so let's get into it as you see I

have the physical copy here that's how I

read it but I have also uh purchased a

pdf version of this so I have this is

all legal I have the the I have done my

purchases so I can show you a little bit

from the the contents as I'm going along

because it's really important that I

drive home some of the key concepts of

artificial intelligence of tcas I mean

um and as I'm learning about artificial

intelligence so I've been reading this

book and I took took notes first in this

little notebook and then later in a

another notebook now

normally I would process these on the

same day or the next day however my life

has been extremely hectic these past

couple of weeks and I just had a a

little bit of time in the evening to

actually do the reading so I prioritized

just reading and then taking the notes

um so I'm I'm kind kind of working

through the backlog of notes ideally

this is done on the same day so I'm not

sure how fresh everything is still in my

mind as I go through this but uh here we

go so here are the scribbles that I took

for this and I'm just going to start

with uh with the first

scribbles and it says here Ray Curts

while definition of Singularity when AI

reaches and exceeds human intelligence

powered by

self-learning by learning autonomously

and

self-improving so that's the first

that's the first thought that I'm

capturing the first thing that I'm

capturing because all everything in this

um settle casting system is about

modularity modular nodes so I can either

use my obsidian or my command line well

to get started a bit easier I will just

start with obsidian so I'm going to

create a new node and that is going to

be this note is actually about Ray

cordts while definition of Singularity

so I will do ray cords

Wilds definition of singularity

that is the the name of the note and I

should probably also just

enable uh show me the key so you can see

which keys I'm pressing as I'm

navigating

this here we go so now you should be

able to see what I'm doing and the apple

key here is the super key so Ray CW's

definition of Singularity and I've

already made a

mistake I see okay so here we go Ray

csw's definition of

Singularity when

AI

reaches and exceeds

so this is the notes that I wrote down

in my notebook when AI reaches and

exceeds human intelligence powered by

learning autonomously and

self-improving now I always write down

my notes in my own words it's always my

own words but it doesn't mean that it

doesn't contain any similar words so if

I just go to my the book here and I've

just search for Ray or for just kurts

while here so this is the original quote

this is the original uh quote

here Ray kurtwell and his vision of the

singularity in which a AI empowered by

its ability to improve itself and learn

on its own will quickly reach and then

exceed human level intelligence so let

me

just um cop that so above here is my own

note and down here is the original text

so you can see here that I instead of

saying like one change I did is that

here in the end it says then exceed

human level intelligence well I brought

that to the front when AI reaches and

exceeds human intelligence powered by

learning

autonomously and here it says empowered

by its ability to to improve itself and

learn on its own and I turn that into

learning autonomously and

self-improving so I am like I'm keep I'm

keeping the same meaning but I put it

into my own words and this process of

putting it into your own words really

solidifies your thinking and this is the

the key aspect of uh the ttle Casten

method that you don't just take this and

copy it into your system and Tada you're

done that doesn't have any value at all

like maybe you have a nice quote for

later but it doesn't have any value this

has value because this is a note that I

can use later in my own writing and I

can just you I I can use this as my own

writing I just need to stitch a few of

these notes together and I have an essay

so

I might here also uh include a reference

to the page number uh that I used so I

will then include a reference that I

took this from

page XX in the

prologue so just so that I know later if

I want to find rayer while definition of

Singularity again I know where to look

so that was my first note and

this is all that I want to have in this

in this note I just simply want to

capture rord Well's definition of

Singularity and for now I can I could

just create a link to

Singularity

actually

Singularity because I I know that I'm

going to be linking to that in other

notes as

well so I created this link and now this

node is done

let's go to the next

one

so as I was reading this I was actually

very interested in definitions of AI

first of all like that's everything

needs to start with the definitions in

my opinion and I'm now studying AI

because I want to I feel I've mastered

kubernetes to a degree that I can learn

what I need to learn I can use it for

what I need to use it for I can work

with it and now I want to deepen my

knowledge on artificial

intelligence and in order to do that I'm

just starting with the basics with the

definitions and then going from there

so um I already have a note called

artificial intelligence which I can

open oh I have to artificial

intelligence

so let me just enable show me the key

again go

so this is my artificial intelligence

note

already and I think I will add a

definition section on this note because

I use index notes for all of my um all

of my settle cast and work I might some

people call these maps of content I like

the the term index better so so actually

I'm going to create a new heading here

called

definitions and I'm going to add um

definition of artificial

intelligence and I'm also going to add

the word AI just because it becomes more

searchable now I am going to add this to

my daily node as well as you see I am

creating all of these nodes from my

daily notes and I'll explain later why I

do that so just bear with me I'm just

going to process these notes first and

then I'm going to show you how I am

going to be structuring these notes and

referring them to one

another so the next note is as

follows this is exactly what I wrote

term AI invented by

for

okay so this is the these are the notes

that I wrote in my little notebook

here and now I'm going to

continue I'm going to just sit here and

reflect on what I wrote there and how I

do I want to pull this apart do I I

think this is enough and again these are

all in my own words except for this um

this part

here and because I I took this note

these notes maybe a week or two ago it's

not fresh in my mind anymore and this is

why it's so important that you make it a

habit to process these notes like on the

same day or the day after because then

you remember the context and I don't

really remember the context anymore so

I'm actually going to go and read about

McCarthy

again

McCarthy so here here it speaks about

McCarthy and he was um he basically came

up with the term uh artificial

intelligence McCarthy later admitted

that no one really liked the name after

the goal was genuine not artificial

intelligence but I had to call it

something so I called it artificial

intelligence so he's the one that came

up with the

term and here it says that

um organize a two-month 10man study of

artificial intelligence to be carried

out during the summer of

1956 the term artificial intelligence

was McCarthy's invention so here it says

literally that he came up with the term

and that's why I noted it down like this

so

um that is basically the source of this

line here invented by McCarthy in

1956 he founded Stanford AI project in

the early 60s that is that is later

so here I might create a note about this

MC McCarthy person but as I've continued

in the book he is not really mentioned

as much anymore I'm not necessarily

interested in knowing more about him but

I do have notes about people like Brian

Johnson for

example like I I would have a note about

that person and then I would like um

have notes about that person be linked

from that note for example but this time

I don't need to do that because McCarthy

is not as interesting to me I just want

to capture who invented the term so I'm

happy with

this I'm happy with this

[Music]

um this setup it's it's just a nice

clean sentence that says where the

definition of AI comes from so next is

the actual

definition and here I have used quotes

So that is interesting and now I'm going

to be looking

at how that's actually phrased in

the in

[Music]

the

document here we go a branch of computer

science that studies the properties of

intelligence by synthesizing

intelligence so here it's it talks he

the author talks about in a recent

report on the current state of AI a

committee of prominent researchers

defined the field as a branch of

computer science that studies properties

of intelligence by synthesizing

intelligence so this is the the

definition that is being being used in

the book itself so here it it speaks

more about like it it it goes more into

the

details of it but this is the moment

where the author takes a stance and

gives a

definition now this one you may notice I

have not

um turned into my own words so in my

settle cast course which you can get by

joining my Cube pref Community the link

will be down below it's a full course on

how to create your ttle Casten in

obsidian but in this course I put a lot

of emphasis that Nicholas Lumen the

inventor of the ttle cast method rarely

used quotes you should use them very

sparingly and I also use them very

sparingly but very sparingly does not

mean that you should never use them and

in this case there is a committee that

went out and came out with a definition

and here I think it is

actually

uh a good decision to use the specific

wording of that

definition and I have I did change it a

little bit I see I left out a little bit

so actually now I just I now that I

review it again I want to just just take

the entire

text I think I might have abbreviated

that because I didn't write it all

didn't want to write it all out by

hand

okay and then the context is a committee

of prominent researchers defined the

field

in a recent report so let's check out

what

that

uh report is about 100e study on

artificial intelligence interesting so

can we find that

report here we go

okay so this is the the report The

Source material and then I think I I

kind of like to include this report

here oh

oops I will just include this link into

the

note so so that is then the source

material comes from 100e study on

artificial

intelligence

so I will include that link in

here

okay and I will copy the name of

it and then I will write the context

myself I will

say um the author takes a stance on the

definition of

artificial intelligence in

chapter what is the

chapter definitions and getting on with

it

page so what is the page of

that page six

the author takes a stance on the

definition of artificial intelligence in

page six um using

the what is what does you call it a

study committee of prominent

researchers a recent report on the

current state of

AI using the

definition she

offers offers the

definition used in a report on the state

of AI by

Stanford 100e study on artificial

intelligence a branch of computer

science that studies the properties of

intelligence by synthesizing

intelligence

okay so now I have kind of put this into

my own words I'm I I'm now reflecting on

the definition itself where it came from

exactly how she phrased it and like

we're probably already 10 minutes into

the video and I'm only on my second note

and I'm showing you

this like laboriously I'm showing you

exactly what I do I'm not doing this

hastily to get views this view this

video is probably going to get horrible

watch time because I'm just so slow but

the point of the settle cast method is

to take it slow it won't work if you do

it quickly what I'm showing you here is

the actual thinking process that I go

through it's the actual process that

enables me to learn 10 times faster

faster than my peers because I engage

deeply with the material that most

people just don't have the patience for

and a settle cast method is a vehicle to

enable

that okay so

later so this I might expand with other

notes reflecting on this definition but

I am currently happy with this

definition like a branch of computer

science that studies the properties of

intelligence by synthesizing

intelligence that is basically a very

clear and concise definition of the term

artificial

intelligence but later I have written AI

is a field with the goal of creating

machines with

intelligence and I wish I had noted

where I got that from

but this is just

a this is just a note that I wrote

myself these are my own words I didn't

quote around it this is just my own

words

basically and maybe field of

um let me see AI is a field with the

goal of creating machines with

intelligence I'm

just oh

here here is it here it

is an enchy of methods so this is a this

actually came

earlier let me see let's read through

this in fact in much of the popular

media the term artificial intelligence

itself has come to mean deep learning

this is an unfortunate inaccuracy and I

need to clarify the

distinction AI is a field that includes

a broad set of approaches with the goal

of creating machines with intelligence

that is basic this is the broad

definition of what we're doing deep

learning is only one sub approach deep

learning is itself one method among many

in the field of machine learning a sub

field of AI in which machines learn from

data or from their own

experiences okay so this this comes a

bit later actually this is then yes this

is the definitions and getting on with

it chap

this is the next chapter

so I actually like this uh this chapter

a lot and it says AI it really pulls it

apart it makes it very clear what AI is

and what it's not so AI is a field let's

let's break this

down for the sake of clarity I will just

um break this up I will copy this and

just break it up a bit so here this is

what I wrote AI is a field with the goal

of creating machines with

intelligence so I did quote a bit of it

I would say I I'm paraphrasing here

because I'm leaving out a bit of the the

quote so I did put this in my own words

in that

sense

so um

the goal of the AI field is to create

machines with

intelligence then I will just in the

following

chapter the

author makes some very

important distinctions

she

highlights that in popular

media the term AI has become

synonimous with deep

learning this is

unfortunate and this

is yeah here we go this is an

unfortunate

accuracy in fact much of the popular

media the term out of itself become to

mean deep learning so you see how

I'm I did this from memory I read just

read this but I rewrote it in a slightly

different way in the following

chapter and I'll include the chapter

name which is

called an anarchy of methods

the author makes some very important

distinctions she highlights that in

popular media the term a has become

synonymous with deep learning and here

she

says has come to mean deep learning so

it is a different way of phrasing it but

still means the same so this these are

my own words I can just publish this as

my own words and I won't be infringing

on any

copyright well well I'm also attributing

the meaning to the author so it's a very

careful balancing act that you need to

do as a writer but this is what I also

mean with writing as if ready for

publication Nicholas Lumen did this so

whenever you write notes in a ttle cast

and like this you have to write as if

it's going to be published and what I'm

writing here is basically a a whole

chapter of a blog post or an essay or

whatever I could just use this as a full

note or a full

um

resource so again she aular become

synonymous of deep learning this is

unfortunate she goes on to explain that

the goal of the AI field is to create

machines with

intelligence deep

learning is a

what do you call

it here she says is only one such

approach it's one method among many in

the field of machine

learning deep learning is

a

method an

approach I like the word method

deep learning is itself one method among

many in the field of machine learning a

subfield of

AI deep learning is

actually

a method which is part of machine

learning deep learning is a type of

artificial not AI itself I like

that and then later there is machine

learning but that I also have

a yeah another note that I wrote down

here where it

says this is what I wrote

down okay so this is what I wrote down a

subfield of AI in which machines learn

from data or from their own experiences

mhm so that is then definitely going to

be a new

note about machine learning that's going

to be a new index in my system I

suppose because machine learning is not

AI machine

learning is a sub field of

AI and I like the word

subfield but I will just call it

a yeah okay I will just copy the word

subfield in this case because it's well

maybe thesaurus

well this is maybe a time where I would

maybe uh ask

Claude sometimes it's if I'm stuck then

I

will help because

um English is not my first language so I

like to use

thesaurus but um sometimes I just use

my

um I use AI to find a u synonym for

words so let's find another way of

phrasing subfield

here a branch of a domain within AI

yeah a domain within AI I like

that deep learning is itself one method

among many in the field of using a

branch of AI yeah a branch I like that

one a branch so here I'm going to refine

this into machine learning is a branch

of

AI where machines learn from their own

data or

experiences so

here a subfield of AI in which machines

learn from data or their own

experiences I have kind of put this in a

different way I mean I know the concept

now I know that its relation to AI but I

have taken a different word and by doing

this process I have molded over in my

mind and therefore it is more lodged

into my mind now and this why it's so

important that I do take my time to

really deeply reflect on this and spend

some quality time while doing

this so how

this which belongs to I belong to

machine

learning deep learning is a type of

artificial intelligence not AI

itself

okay so then machine

learning this can actually be a a

separate note so this is a definition of

machine

learning and that one I will actually

add to the

definitions one here

but as you see it Springs from this note

where I'm defining Ai and in that way

the fact that machine learning is a

subfield of AI is now reflected in this

note let me see she goes on to

explain yes

so this note

then talks about machine learning is a

branch of AI where machines learn from

their own data or

experiences so I've now processed

another page in my little

notebook and I didn't write any further

any much further on machine learning as

I wrote these notes down but now I'm

kind of interested in the fact

where the author takes she she uses this

um oh I should actually add

this one again here

okay okay

so here here she she quotes this word

experiences and now I kind of want to

know more about um these experiences and

this I will actually just use Claude

for in this sentence the

author um has has put experiences in

quotes I'm trying I'm learning I'm

studying AI from the ground up and I'd

like to know more about what you

think author implied

by putting this in

quotes I

realize machines can't

actually experience anything but could

you explain it to

me let me see what Claud

says you've touch on a fascinating and

philosophically Rich question the use of

quotation marks about learn experience

signals that their analogies or

proximations when we say machines learn

it's fundamentally different from Human

learning

learning yeah what's really happening is

statistical pattern recognition yeah

exactly yeah she goes into that later in

in the

book optimization of numer yeah so it's

not actually learning in the sense of

how a human

learns similarly a machine experiences

aren't experiences in any conscious or

phenomenological sense they're really

just input data points training examples

and recorded interactions or

outcomes

now I love how how Claude is explaining

this the quotation marks serve as a kind

of epistemological humility

acknowledging that we're borrowing terms

from Human cognition and Consciousness

to describe what what are essentially

mathematical and computational processes

oh this is so good I wish I wrote that

myself

it's similar how to how we might say a

thermostat knows when to turn on the

heat it's a useful metaphor but no one

would argue that the thermostat has

actual knowledge in the way humans

do this distinction becomes particularly

important in AI ethics and philosophy of

Mind

discussions wow this is so good thank

you so much

Claude while AI systems can process

information and adjust their behavior

Behavior Based on data there is still an

open question about whether they can

have genuine experiences or

Consciousness in the way biological

entities

do okay so this is really useful and

this is also I'm showing you this

because I often use Claude in this way

as a kind of Mentor or teacher and I use

AI to it's fascinating that I'm now

using AI to learn about AI that in

itself is hugely fascinating

but I really like the way Claude put

this and I'm

actually like I'm not a fan of

copying um AI or copying text straight

from Ai and this is definitely not going

to be published but this is just so good

that I'm not going to let this go to

waste so in the

book The author put learn and

experiences in quotation

marks

signaling that we do

not signaling that machines do not

actually learn or

experience however for the

sake for for the sake of

communication we must use the these

words to

indicate that machine learning can

enable machines to perform

tasks better and better over

time we use the word the the human term

learning for this

but in reality what's happening is that

the model is gaining more

accurate

statistical

data so this is basically my own

phrasing of this so yes I am I'm reusing

the AI text here and

then

CLA when I ask CLA thought about this it

generated this fascinating piece of

text

so usually I won't like have my notes

this large but in this case this is just

something that I I stumble upon and I

really like how Claude explained this

but I'm just going to indicate that this

was gener ated by Claude and then I can

use this note later for further

reflection if I want to go deeper into

how machines learn or

experience but I've I've realized the

point I like it it it drove the point

home to me that machines don't actually

learn it's just statistical pattern

recognition and for the the stage of my

research that I'm in currently that is

all I need to know I don't necessarily

want to go deep into how machines

actually learn and how these models

actually work although I did take more

notes on that which I'm going to be

doing in the next section but this um

this is how deep I want to go and then I

use this as data for later reference and

I can also include the claw link here so

I can just find that later and then um

now I'm I'm finished with this this

note okay so now that I

have a few notes created now now I can

show you how I will actually structure

this um because I've now been adding

these both to

my daily note and this artificial

intelligence note but what I also like

to do is

to create input nodes so what I do is I

create a note that represents this

book and let me see artificial

intelligence a guide for thinking

humans so this this is the note that

represents the book and I'm moving this

to input

books I have every book I read that I

take notes

on it has its own entry in my in my

system and then from this note I'm going

to be

adding um

these as well so

and let's turn that into a bulleted list

because I like the look of that here we

go so what this

achieves and I I I show you all of this

because I want to show you why I do this

so what this achieves by adding it from

the daily note the artificial

intelligence note and having my um book

note where these notes originate from is

that I can for example go to the

definition of artificial intelligence

Noe and when I then go to the back Links

of this note I see where it comes from

so if I do the what is it local graph

open local graph here so

here I see that this note is linked to

several notes Here I can see that it was

created on this date because that's

where it spawned from so if I click

there then I can also see what I was up

to on that day and I see that I have

created different AI related notes on

that day that is interesting

already then I see that it is part of an

index node called artificial

intelligence and Ai and this one has a

lot of different notes

already and going back to definition of

intelligence I also see that this note

actually spawned a different note here

we go and this is why I like to do it

this way and maybe I can even

excal excalibrate do I have that open

yeah here we

go this is another way why another

reason why I like to do it when I use

excal brain this be with this one it

becomes even clearer so here I have my

artificial intelligence note but this is

myart Definition of artificial

intelligence and here it becomes even

clearer that this note its parent notes

are um The Daily note

here and the book note I can see that

this note comes from there and then this

note led to this note machine learning

is a branch of

AI and now I can see that this

note its parents are also here it's on

the this daily note is in the

book and it

is

um related to these other notes now when

I take this book note here I see that it

originated from this date so this is

when I started writing about it that can

be an interesting point of data to have

but because the way excal brain renders

it I see that this note relates led to

the following notes down here and I can

see its

interrelations so if I were to link Ray

cords

whil uh definition of Singularity to the

machine learning note for

example then I should be able to see

that

uh here yeah here we see that this this

link is now um it is now connected to

this note which wasn't there before I

don't actually want to connect it to it

but it's just an example and for me I

like to use these visual explorations of

my tcast and to when I go deeper into

this and I want to see visually which

notes are related to what and I can ex

expand the the number of branches and

such like it is super

useful

so these are the first not few notes

that I've created on this topic now in

the next section I'm going to be using

my neovim workflow and showing you how I

use that as

well e
