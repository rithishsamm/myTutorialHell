Getting Started with Note Taking Systems:

This is mostly going to be theory of what, why, how of the NOTE TAKING SYSTEM. 

First, note taking but before we get into all of that information of learning stuff and all that we are about to study - 
I think it's actually important that I teach you how to actually ==process that information.==

and that's why we should start with having a proper **Note Taking System**. 

in order so the title of this video is everything starts with a not taking system and that's not a coincidence.

**everything starts with a ==good note taking system** ==

Notes are the Cornerstone of Success and it allows to achieve milestones in record time.

I changed your career to devops and MORE ACHIVEEMNTS SUCH AS YT, BLOG, CERTS AND GITHUB DEVOPS DOCS PROJ all while working a full-time job and all of this was achieved in the span of LITTLE AMOUNT OF 
years.

So, **Productivity**, the maximizing the amount of output you can generate 
in the amount of time that you have is a super important skill to learn

and the basis of taking notes of a productivity system is a note taking system. 

All these years, fucking around and finding out figuring your career. While upskilling and learning stuff. made several attempts and I failed several times but then I actually went all in on it. end up doing every possible roadblocks and following all the utter worst bad practices. Taking long ass notes using Sticky notes and more.

when I made that your life's Mission to pursue the career that i got end up having. I know and I knew I was going all in. I had found your passion and I was prepared to do anything to make it come true.

After progress, end up having a system that works for me. and ended up following others productivity systems and implemented as per your convenience.

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT THAT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW BUT TO GET INSPIRE BY OR TO GET A GIST OF A NECESSITY OF HAVING A PRODUCTIVITY SYSTEM OF YOUR OWN.

and I uh I made it your life life's mission to get a career in Tech and 


now as I said I was always tinkering with Linux and computers in your free time and I had almost a year of experience of scripting coding automating video games and all of that but I didn't have any professional experience in in it. 

so I had a lot of knowledge 
but I also knew that I had to gain even more knowledge  there was so much

that I needed to get so much to do in so little time 
and I also needed to make an income while I was doing it 

**so I needed to make look for ways to make learning as efficient as possible.** 

As i previously said, i've been fucking around and finding out figuring your career. Study after work and more stuff. letting go this and that. After much fucks given, , end up having a system that kind of worked for me. 

Also during this R&D phase. So ended up following others productivity systems and implemented as per your convenience.

and during this research, I came across productivity YouTubers and these guys with their 
- second brain systems 
- notion  
- time management techniques and 

it's actually really cool it's really cool that all of this information is out there now / on other hand it's also a lot of information there's too much productivity 

**I'm trying to distill all of that down for you.**

so I noticed one pattern that all of these guys had and that it was a they all had 
> **a well organized not taking system**

so I knew what I needed to do, went all in and went really deep into this rabbit hole. 

and you might say well if you want to go into Tech why not studying Tech, that's a very valid point but I was studying these things because it would make your tech studies much more efficient. 

==and that has proven to be correct that that **learning a good study techniques** **having a good notetaking system has supercharge your productivity and allows me to do all of everything that I do** ==

but I so I have zero regrets spending that time but you don't have to spend that time 

I did that for you and I'm giving you everything I've learned. 

so before I started, it's very ly that you're starting out this too . 

- you probably have a Google Drive and on that drive,
- there's going to be tons of folders and 
- in those folders there's going to be a few notes or a few documents Google Docs and 
- they all have names and
- it's just scattered all over the place and then 
- on your computer you are going to have a uh you you're going to have a documents folder 
- In that documents folder, there might be a folder with studies and
- there might be a folder with uh I don't know your some something about your personal interests 
- so now you have something in Google Docs and now you have something on your laptop and then 
- maybe on an old laptop you have even more when you were studying College you took all these notes and 
- all these notes are stored in an old laptop 
> **it's very ly that you just me all of your notes are scattered everywhere** because 
> - there's no sort of system behind it and 
> - there's no intention behind it
 
**==It is very important to becoming intentional about your note taking.==** 
because we all take these lectures in college. we all sit there we randomly write stuff down. and we read it when we have the test, but we don't actually put a lot of thought into what we write down and 
how it's going to benefit us in the future 

and 

it's really weird that this skill is not not not taught in institutions. we are expected to take notes but nobody tells us how to actually do it.

so you probably have this scattered system and you probably never revisit these notes. you never use these notes. 

why not? well, because there is 
- no structure in place that makes it easy to find these notes, 
- you need structure, 
- you need intentionality, 
- you need to have a system to this and 

it's so important to do this with **intention with a clear plan**, because if you don't it's you're just going to have a proliferation of notes that you don't know what to do with and *that's probably what you already have now.*

### WHY SHOULD WE TAKE NOTES IN THE FIRST PLACE?
#### 1) ==WRITING== 
###### **Fosters and facilitates understanding through ==writing==.**
 
when you take notes in a proper way then, 
- you do it in your own words. 
- you take a technical concept for example. CS50, CS BASICS. What is computer kind of stuff.

we'll get into that but when I was studying containers i i i the way I remembered things, each one has its own metaphor. that is how I this is how I remembered containers and 

I still remember it I can speak to you eloquently about containers with that metaphor because when I was studying stud in containers 3 years ago.

I wrote a note that containers are a newspaper and this is how **writing can facilitate understanding because you if you force yourself to put things into your own words a process of translation takes place almost as if you're translating it to a different language you're hooking it to your own sort of hooks that you have in your mind**, 
- everybody has their own hooks in the mind. 
- everybody has their own experiences, 
- previous experiences, 
- everybody has their own Adventures,  
- stories, 
- things you've read,
- games you've played and 
> **you can connect all of these things to your unique little things and then use that to explain the technique for yourself in writing** 

and when you do that then you're going to remember. 

so that is one reason to take notes it it facilitates and fosters understanding.

#### 2) ==Create== 
###### **Notes can be used to ==create== stuff.**

If you have a big note taking system that You have built which works for you, might have over 1,000s notes in your system.

Whenever I want to write a blog post ->  I just go through your note taking system -> and see if there's anything cool that I noted down a month ago. ->  that inspires me to create a video / to create a blog post.

You will always have answers. You will never run out of things that you'd like to create with 
where you have listed down all of these ideas that already are written out in the notes that you have in your system.

so. 

every time I create ->  I just sit down ->  pick up the notes that I have already before -> stitch them together -> create something new out of it.

and finally there is ***reference***

#### 2) ==Reference== 
reference, means
###### **The ability to look up information and ==refer== to it**. 

so if you have a well organized system that has a good structure to it 
->  that you can use search on ->  then you are able to store and retrieve information super quick.

so earlier stage, joined the team and I took notes on everything.
everything the seniors were teaching me things -> I wrote them down ->  then I had that in your system -> when doing new projects I was always documenting them in your own system -> also in in the proper documentation system -> but then the seniors very quickly figured out that I always had it saved in your system -> they started asking me questions about "how did we set that up the other day" or "how did we fix that problem"

I always wrote everything down -> so it took me two seconds of searching and because I had a system in place that facilitates that -> I had the answer within 5 Seconds. 
--> well fast forward a couple of months -> then there the team would have meetings where the Juniors were not included because it was too advanced -> 

then had the meetings with the senior engineers and the managers ->  and then the the senior Engineers they were explaining some project that they were doing -> and then they thought ->  they didn't have some information available -> and they said oh wait wait we have to call me * -knows it -> and then I was called in -> and within a few seconds I had the information ->  well if a manager sees that happening three times ->  instantly you are a senior engineer -> because you are being dragged in into meetings because you have the information -> and doesn't matter what your years of experience are you are going to be perceived as a senior engineer because ->  **you're able to look to have the information look it up** ->  and **explain it eloquently** ->  because **you understand it deeply** because 
- **==you wrote about it in your own system==** and because 
- you are writing blog posts about it in the evening by creating

##### RECAP:
- writing notes properly facilitates understanding 
- they allow you to create things, blog posts, videos and 
- they allow you to reference things very efficiently and quickly 

so to expand on this even further 
this is writing!  so,
> if I can't write about something, then 
> - I don't understand the topic and 

**clear thinking becomes clear writing, one can't exist without the other**
**-William Zinsser**

 I was saying about these learnings, I figured something out your own metaphor,  but if 
 - I'm studying something and 
 - I'm unable to write about it 
 - I'm unable to take not notes in your own words 
 it means 
 - I don't understand the topic 
 - it means I need to dig further into it 

writing is thinking on paper 
writing is the basis of everything 
writing is the basis of study / content creation / elequent / composing emails and it is just
writing! writing! writing!

How do you practice writing? 
- by writing
- by writing a lot
- by writing a ton
- by writing a ton everyday
how do you writing a ton everyday
- by writing a ton
- by writing all the notes
- by writing everything that you do 

My system is based around two fundamental principles. 
- input
- output

![[Pasted image 20241212123553.png]]

YOO NEED TO START SEE YOURSELF AS A FACTORY.

1) a factory that takes **input** to your system (such as 
- conversations/ 
- blogs/
- articles/ 
- YouTube videos/ 
- books and 
- all of the content 
you consume goes into your ear.

->
2) and then the factory is 
- **processing** all this information /
- writing it in your own words /
- it's putting it into its own categories/
- it's attaching it to the hooks 

-> 
then you can use that input as **output** for other things such as your 
- blog posts/
- emails/
- videos courses/
- newsletter/
- social media content 
- and much more

one of the biggest hacks to stand out when you're looking for a job is to have a social media presence, to have a proper online presence.
*you will find also an article about the importance of your online presence.*

and if you have a good note taking system. -> this allows you to generate 
this output to have whatever possible
- a Blog 
- videos or 
- start a YouTube channel 
- to write on Twitter every day 
because you just use the notes that you write already
you just post them to Twitter and there you go 

so you have to become a factory that 
takes input -> processes it to create products of some kind -> cherish output

that's how you need to start seeing yourself as you begin this journey into devops.

ENOUGH OF EMPHASISING.
WILL SEE ALL THESE IN THIS SERIES's UPCOMING EPISODES ONE BY ONE.
- we are going to dive into further and dig deeper into note taking systems.
- we're going to dive into all of the tools that you can use 
- we're going to dive into the methods that you can use with these tools 
will be explaining everything you need to know to start building your own note taking system.

but if you this is going to take a while for me to finish all these but it is worth investing and hoping you to take immense output out of this. 

you get access to all these here and you can get a taste of what it is to be in a truly supportive Community. 

THANK YOU!

See ya!
