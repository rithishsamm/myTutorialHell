when I reach the point of note making

Mastery I realized that the system

doesn't matter the par method ttle

Casten or whatever system you choose

they are just that systems writing notes

skillfully is the only thing that really

matters I say this to you because my

note taking videos are attracting a lot

of views and new subscribers I see

students entering my paid community and

consuming all of the courses in one day

and then as you might expect they get

extremely confused about no taking and

start asking questions questions about

all of these systems these are questions

such as should I put this note in an

area or a resource folder how do I

combine para and settle Casten what

should my Noe titles be and how should I

link them these questions will all

answer themselves when you make the

following fundamental cognitive

shift instead of seeing your notes as a

collection of information you must view

your notes as the place where you do

your deepest and best thinking your note

taking system is the garden where you

cultivate your knowledge like a medieval

monk tending to his herb garden with

total concentration you must start

tending to your notes as if they were

fragile plants that need great

care I therefore suggest that we start

using the words note making instead of

note

taking a skilled note maker is not

hoarding information a skilled note

maker does not copy and paste text into

his system a skilled note not maker

takes the information he consumes and

converts that information into his own

knowledge

assets this is the fundamental

difference between note taking and note

making we don't just copy and hoard we

cultivate and

refine the foundation of note making is

that you must always write in your own

words but be prepared note making feels

arduous and exhausting in the beginning

this is exactly what you should feel

you are challenging your own thinking

and you are verifying your own

understanding the very fact that the

process is hard and challenging means

that it's a process worth doing the act

of writing notes in your own words

demands deep thinking and forces you to

Grapple with the material until it is

truly

understood when you encounter

difficulties in this process it serves

as a clear indicator that you need to

delve deeper into the

subject there's no growth with without

discomfort the strenuous feeling

indicates that you are literally

changing your mind this is the true

purpose of note making to reveal gaps in

your understanding and to crystallize

your own thinking learn to write

skillfully crafted notes and your life

will change

take your skills to the next

level to shape the art of not making I

have created the following set of

principles may they serve you well in

your note making

Journey one write don't highlight two

curate don't

collect three refine don't

rush the first principle is write don't

highlight before I attained notem

Mastery I highlighted passages

extensively in books believing this

practice would Aid my

learning however I realized that I

rarely if ever Revisited these

highlights consider your own experience

how often do you engage with the

passages you've highlighted in books

this extends to digital tools as well

don't use readwise or browser extensions

that allow direct clipping of text into

your not taking system while they are

convenient these methods often fall

short in promoting deep engagement with

the

material instead write your notes in

your own

words instead of quoting write in the

second section of the article the author

makes a compelling statement where he

recommends writing in your own words

instead of

highlighting use your own mind to engage

with the material instead of blindly

copy pasting think deeply about the

information and turn it into

knowledge if the information is not

worth going through this process it's

probably not worth keeping anyway write

don't

highlight the second principle is curate

don't

collect thoughtfully consider each

addition to your note making system your

notes are your garden of knowledge which

you are cultivating with great care and

attention like a well- tended Garden

each plant has its place in the

composition in gardens some plants will

attract useful creatures which will also

benefit the other

plants always try to enhance your other

nodes by reflecting how they relate to

the other areas of your

life don't fall into the Trap of blindly

hoarding information without much

thought there's no merit in a huge

collection of notes that don't carry

meaning curate don't

collect the third principle is refine

don't

rush spend quality time with your notes

start seeing the act of not making as

active self-development like meditation

or

exercise writing notes in your own words

is the Pinnacle of mental craftsmanship

writing is thinking on paper and as you

refine your notes your thinking will

deepen imagine a blacksmith in his Forge

he keeps heating the steel hammering it

out on his Anvil and carefully examining

the result then he will heat it again

and he will keep hammering at that area

that needs

Improvement like a well forged blade

hone to Perfection build your nodes with

purpose Clarity and

precision see your not note making as a

craft use it to sharpen your thinking

write and rewrite your notes until they

are crystal clear without

impurities refine don't

rush internalize the teachings I have

just given you and your questions about

where should this note go will

disappear focus on the act of note

making instead of worrying about where

to put them these questions will answer

themselves as your own garden of

knowledge unfolds before your eyes over

time like anything good in the world it

takes discipline effort and time but I

promise you it will change your life for

the better I offer this for your

reflection check out my community at

school.com cubecraft and may your notes

bring you as much joy and prosperity as

they have brought me
