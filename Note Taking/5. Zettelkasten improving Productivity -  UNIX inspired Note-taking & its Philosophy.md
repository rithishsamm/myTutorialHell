### Modular Nature of ZETTELKASTAN method

We've been learning that how the ZETTELKASTAN method actually makes one so productive.
Lumen was one of the most prolific scholars in the in history and he credited his ZETTELKASTAN and with his productivity so 
- how does that actually work 
- why does a ZETTELKASTAN make you productive and 
- how can a ZETTELKASTAN assist you in your life 

One key aspect:
##### The Modular/Atomic Nature of ZETTELKASTAN Notes:

Every notes in the ZETTELKASTAN contains one idea -> **Atomic notes**

I'd like to call this term Atomic Notes as
==**Modular Notes or a modular approach**==  where each note is a module.

**each note** -> contains a **single idea or concept** written in your own words -> becoming a **self-contained unit of knowledge.**

**==so each note makes perfect sense in and of itself, when you see your note in your system it should make sense by itself ==** 
***because it just presents one idea clearly and and well thought through*** 

**You** 
- **spend quality time with the note**  
- **craft it carefully** 
- **put effort into it so that** 
- **it becomes an independent self-contained unit of knowledge** 
- **that can function independently and**
- **interestingly==**

this has parallels with software engineering principle, one of them is the principle in
- clean code -> **functions should do one thing** and they should do it well, they should do it only 
++ This quote aligns well with **==Unix philosophy==** -> which states that ***programs should do one thing and they should do it well*** 
> The idea is that each unit shouldn't do a thousand different things, it should just focus on one thing and do it well and 
> I think the same parallel can be drawn towards **notes** in the ZETTELKASTAN where 
> -> each note has one idea
- it goes into it concisely and deeply and
- it can function independently meaning that 
- it is written as if ready for publication 

This methodology helps using my note taking system ->  as a way to generate output -> as a way to create content and ->  I take good care into **writing each note as if it's ready to go on my blog.**

so when the time comes to write a blog post,
- I can just pull in my notes and 
- I don't have to do much editing in order to make these notes presentable 
- this forces me to think deeply about the material 
- to write clearly concisely and to write well, but this also makes it that each
- note can function independently because 
- it focuses on one thing and it does it well 

WHAT THIS ALLOWS WHEN YOUR NOTES CAN BE OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY?
-  flexibility
- reusability - recycle your writing / notes 
your notes become independent building blocks so 
- when you have an argument
- it's built up of several elements and
- each note can become one element in the argument 
- this means that if you have a a bunch of notes and
- they would all form an argument so 
- when you sit down to write 
- you pull in several notes and 
- all of these form 
- one article well 
- you can rearrange these notes 
- you can rearrange the order and 
- you can pull in other unrelated notes and 
- you can just stitch them together and 
- see how does it fit in this context and

*this way you can be writing an article on something completely unrelated and somehow you are reminded of a of a note , that you wrote a month ago well you can just pull that in and you can see how that fits this is how I came up with this parallel of clean code principles.*
**==this the Unix philosophy==** 

I was writing this article

that's a basis for this YouTube video about the modularity of notes I hadn't considered the Unix pH philosophy at all but as I was writing I thought hey this really reminds me of the Unix philosophy well I pulled in my notes from that and it worked very well so this is just an an anecdotal example of how having well-crafted notes can lead to
unexpected connections and there's also a visual aspect to it so let's let's go back go to one of my notes in my my early days

of note taking this is a note on bicep the bicep uh language for infrastructure as code well here is a document that  contains many headings here and I wrote a large note containing all of this information now as I look back at this note I see perfect opportunities for refactoring you could say note refactoring or to create independent noes here for example is a heading that I wrote combining strings we can use string interpolation to generate a unique string with a recognizable hardcoded part this is just an example now what I would now do is I would take this and then in obsidian you can do extract current selection and then I would call this um let's see it is in it is about

combining strings well let's keep let's call it combining strings in bicep here so this would be my new note combining strings I would format it like this combining strings in bicep now there is a visual aspect to having modular notes compare if I go back to this note I see the text above I see the text below I see a lot of information that is related here but this actually is quite a lot of stuff to process for your brain and for your eyes when I go
into my note here what I have is a small piece of text I have one thing to focus on I don't have all of this context around me I am now only thinking of combining strings in bicep now what this would do is okay first of all I already see a a spelling mistake this can can get lost into the sea of information when you work with bigger parts of text so here I can see we can use string interpolation to generate a unique string with a recognizable hardcoded so here's the code example and when I would re refine this I would maybe pull in a note about

string interpolation uh in as a general programming principle maybe I've written about that in Python so I would link string interpolation in Python and then I could write here about um bicep string in interpolation let's remove that is different from python string interpolation because Etc so I would pull in a note that is related and I

would think about okay so how is this idea similar or different to that idea and by speak thinking about it this way by speaking about it by writing about it this way I will take this concept that I have and look at it from all possible 
angles and compare it and I pull it apart and I re-engineer it and this is done in a visual Way by pulling out the note like this so that you can focus on only that thing and only think about this thing and this is really powerful this is I believe revolutionary in the way you write notes by pulling it out like this focusing on one thing visually

not having distraction and actually allowing yourself to go deep on this particular idea now in obsidian when you  are writing a larger article like this for example the beauty is that you can just put an exclamation mark in front of it and boom you you have your note here so I do this when I write articles I will pull in all my different notes and let's see do I have a note about uh I don't know python functions here let's say I wanted to have python functions in here

then I would have python functions in there so that's also an older note that I that would need refactory so you can also visually have these nodes rendered like this using obsidian this is why obsidian is so magnificent so this was just an example of how the visual aspect plays a role here as well in the deep thinking instead of seeing this wall of text you can actually focus on one note when you do this you focus on one note you go deep and then you do a

quality investment you do an investment of quality time quality time and effort because like I mentioned writing is thinking so when you isolate a thing you modularize it you see it as one module you think about it deeply you write about it you invest quality time and effort into it and you make you craft this beautiful little note that does its thing that does its work independently this way no taking becomes a vehicle for comprehension and what you're doing here is you are doing the heavy lifting up front so let me attempt to draw like a bar that you would use in weightlifting where you have the the plates like this I think it will be like this this attaches it to the bar

well I should not try to draw beauti oh you get the idea you would grab the bar and then you would start deadlifting right so this is the bar you do the heavy lifting of the writing of the thinking beforehand when each note is beautifully crafted and can work independently you do the work beforehand and then when the time comes to sit down and write an article you pull it in all of these beautiful crafted notes who all are ready for publication and boom within a matter of minutes you can have an article if you do your your work well you do the heavy lifting up front you

form the ideas completely you examine it from all angles you link it to other notes and you describe how it can 
be uh opposing or similar to your other notes and you are you have done the thinking you understand the concept and it is done now when you have this collection of independently crafted notes like I mentioned you can start trying them out in different  contexts 

I mean who speaks about not taking and the Unix philosophy right
 this is a unique idea that I have had as I was writing this article and that was made possible because I have all of these notes on not taking I've done so much deep thinking on not taking but I'm also a a a tech worker I'm a devops engineer and I almost wanted to say a programmer but I'm not a professional programmer yet but I was able to pull in this note about the Unix philosophy into this because I had done the thinking about it earlier and I could place it

and I I could try it out like does this fit and I thought yeah this actually fits really well so you can experiment you can I could have pulled in a note about I don't know cooking or how spices can can um uh unexpectedly strengthen other tastes I don't know I'm just making this up but you can everybody is unique everybody has their own unique interests and everybody will have their own unique not taking Sy systems and they would  pull them in in their in their own unique way leading to very creative new ideas so with these notes the they become building blocks they can be rearranged and one thing that I use this for actually I will just briefly show this before I I end the video because it's already getting a bit long but I do want to uh highlight this um  let's see one way that you can use this is this so this is the canvas that I used for creating my ttle Casas course and if you don't know I

so here is the here is some of the structure like what is a tle cast well I have a note about that  and I have a note about how it was invented by Nicholas Lumen that he was the master of his craft and all of these notes are individually crafted to Perfection and here I would have another concept like how the settle Casten method improves productivity and here I go into actually writing the notes how to take notes writing is thinking fleeting notes so I use this to actually create a a larger structure out  of all of these notes that I had and  this process by itself caused me to refine each of these notes and to do very deep thinking about this so here is

an whole area about the settle Casten lifestyle that I that I um this  philosophy that I created about it that I explain in detail in my course but that you see yourself as a factory with input and output and how you should

limit your input in order to generate quality output so these tools like obsidian allow you to take out all of these well-crafted notes arrange them experiment with them create connections between them and play with them and this has been a massive massive accelerator in my own thinking so this is what I think allows of a for a very effective way of thinking and handling your notes I think this is one of the ways how the the ttle cast method actually makes you more productive because you spend quality time with each note you can reuse your note so that is really important this makes you really productive because if you do the having lifting once then you don't have to think about it the next time when you do it so when you have a large collection of well flashed out ideas you can create very easily you

can create many different articles by combining the same elements into different unique orders so re recycling 
makes one very productive you recycle your own thinking your own effort and

then um lastly there is this visual aspect of it where you break out a note and you allow yourself to be sucked into that note and there is an element of the ability of focus and being able to stick to one idea for a certain period of time and really give it the quality attention to craft something beautiful out of it so this is one aspect of why I think the ttle castle method makes you more productive 

it is seriously the best way to learn this so thank you for your attention and I hope to see you in the next video
