hello my name is Misha I'm a devops

engineer from the Netherlands and a

master of not taking and in this video I

want to go into the modular nature of

settle cast method and this is part of

the question that I'm trying to answer

and how the settle cast method actually

makes one so productive so like we

established last week Lumen was one of

the most prolific scholars in the in

history and he credited his tcast and

with his productivity so how does that

actually work why does a settle cast

make you productive and how can a settle

cast assist you in your

life one key aspect of this is the

modular nature of these

notes so as we spoke about last

week every note in the settle

cast contains one idea

and this is very often referred to as

atomic notes you will have heard this

term probably and I I don't know why but

I never like that term Atomic notes so I

have started to phrase it

as modular notes or a modular approach

to note taking where each note is a

module

each note contains a single idea or

concept written in your own

words becoming a

self-contained unit of

knowledge so each

note makes perfect sense in and of

itself so when you see your note in your

system it should make sense by itself

because it just presents one idea

clearly and and well thought through and

I'm going to go deeper into this later

in the video but the point here is that

you spend quality time with the note and

craft it carefully put effort into it so

that it becomes an independent

self-contained unit of knowledge that

can function

independently and interestingly this has

parallels with software engineering

principles or or computer science

principles one of them is the principle

in clean

code which I am currently

exploring and in here he says functions

should do one thing and they should do

it well they should do it

only and of course clean code is full of

controversy and and all of that but I do

think it is an interesting parallel to

draw here where he states that functions

should do one

thing and this also instantly reminded

me of the Unix

philosophy which states that programs

should do one thing and they should do

it

well and I really like that approach

towards software engineering I really

like that idea that functions should do

one thing and that they should do it

well and you can take this very

literally and I've Speak heard other

people speak about a function should

handle one concept I think that's a very

good good approach to it too but the

idea is that the each

unit shouldn't do a thousand different

things it should just focus on one thing

and do it well and I think the same

parallel can be drawn towards notes in

the settle Casas where each note has one

idea it it it goes into it concisely and

deeply and it is in um it can function

independently meaning that it is

written as if ready for

publication so I realized that not

everybody

in

my in my audience is going to be

blogging or writing on social media and

you don't have to but I am a blogger and

I use my note taking system as a way to

generate output as a way to create

content and I take good care into

writing each note as if it's ready to go

on my blog so when the time comes to

write a blog post I can just pull in my

notes

and I don't have to do much editing in

order to make these notes presentable

this forces me to think deeply about the

material to write clearly concisely and

to write well but this also makes it so

that the node can function independently

because it focuses on one thing and it

does it well so I thought that was an

interesting parallel

here and what this allows when your

notes be can operate independently

it allows

flexibility and

reusability you can

recycle your writing you can recycle

your

notes your notes become independent

building blocks so when you have an

argument it's built up of several

elements and each note can become one

element in the

argument this means that if you

have a a bunch of

notes and they would all form an

argument so when you sit down to write

you pull in several notes and all of

these form one article well you can

rearrange these notes you can rearrange

the order and you can pull in other

unrelated notes and you can just stitch

them together and see oh how does it fit

in this context and this way you can be

writing an article on something

completely unrelated and somehow you are

reminded of a of a note that you wrote a

month ago well you can just pull that in

and you can see how that fits this is

how I came up with this parallel of uh

clean code principles this the Unix

philosophy I was writing this article

that's a basis for this YouTube video

about the modularity of notes I hadn't

considered the Unix pH philosophy at all

but as I was writing I thought hey this

really reminds me of the Unix philosophy

well I pulled in my notes from that and

it worked very well so this is just an

an anecdotal example of how having

well-crafted notes can lead to

unexpected

connections and there's also a visual

aspect to it so let's let's go back go

to one of my notes in my my early days

of note taking this is a note on bicep

the bicep uh language for infrastructure

as code well here is a document that

contains many headings here and I wrote

a large note containing all of this

information now as I look back at this

note I see perfect opportunities for

refactoring you could say note

refactoring or to create independent

noes here for example is a heading that

I wrote combining strings we can use

string interpolation to generate a

unique string with a recognizable

hardcoded part this is just an

example now what I would now do is I

would take this and then in obsidian you

can do extract current

selection and then I would call

this um let's see it is in it is about

combining

strings well let's keep let's call it

combining

strings in bicep here so this would be

my new note combining strings I would

format it like

this combining strings in bicep now

there is a visual aspect to having

modular notes compare if I go back to

this note I see the text above I see the

text below I see a lot of information

that is related here but this actually

is quite a lot of stuff to process for

your brain and for your eyes when I go

into my note

here what I have is a small piece of

text I have one thing to focus on I

don't have all of this context around me

I am now only thinking of combining

strings in bicep now what this would do

is okay first of all I already see a a

spelling mistake this can can get lost

into the sea of information when you

work with bigger parts of text so here I

can see we can use string interpolation

to generate a unique string with a

recognizable hardcoded so here's the

code

example and when I would re refine this

I would maybe pull in a note about

string

interpolation uh in as a

general programming principle maybe I've

written about that in Python so I would

link string interpolation in Python and

then I could write here about um bicep

string in

interpolation let's remove that is

different from python string

interpolation because Etc so I would

pull in a note that is related and I

would think about okay so how is this

idea similar or different to that idea

and by speak thinking about it this way

by speaking about it by writing about it

this way I will take this concept that I

have and look at it from all possible

angles and compare it and I pull it

apart and I re-engineer it and this is

done in a visual Way by pulling out the

note like this so that you can focus on

only that thing and only think about

this thing and this is really powerful

this is I believe revolutionary in the

way you write notes by pulling it out

like this focusing on one thing visually

not having distraction and actually

allowing yourself to go deep on this

particular

idea now in obsidian when you are

writing a larger article like this for

example the beauty is that you can just

put an exclamation mark in front of it

and boom you you have your note here so

I do this when I write articles I will

pull in all my different notes and let's

see do I have a note about uh I don't

know python functions here let's say I

wanted to have python functions in here

then I would have python functions in

there

so that's also an older note that I that

would need

refactory so you can also visually have

these nodes rendered like this using

obsidian this is why obsidian is so

magnificent so this was just an example

of how the visual aspect plays a role

here as well in the deep thinking

instead of seeing this wall of text you

can actually focus on one

note when you do this you focus on one

note you go deep and then you do a

quality investment you do an investment

of

quality time

quality time and

effort because like I mentioned writing

is thinking so when you isolate a thing

you modularize it you see it as one

module you think about it deeply you

write about it you invest quality time

and effort into it and you make you

craft this beautiful little note that

does its thing that does its

work independently

this way no taking becomes a vehicle for

comprehension and what you're doing here

is you are doing the heavy lifting up

front so let me attempt to draw like a

bar that you would use in

weightlifting where you have the the

plates like this I think it will be like

this this attaches it to the bar

well I should not try to draw beauti oh

you get the idea you would grab the bar

and then you would start deadlifting

right so this is the bar you do the

heavy lifting of the writing of the

thinking

beforehand when each note is beautifully

crafted and can work

independently you do the work beforehand

and then when the time comes to sit down

and write an article you pull it in all

of these beautiful crafted notes who all

are ready for publication and boom

within a matter of minutes you can have

an article if you do your your work well

you do the heavy lifting up front you

form the ideas completely you examine it

from all angles you link it to other

notes and you describe how it can

be uh opposing or similar to your other

notes and you are you have done the

thinking you understand the concept and

it is

done now when

you have this collection of

independently crafted notes like I

mentioned you can start trying them out

in different

contexts I mean who speaks about not

taking and the Unix philosophy right

this is a unique idea that I have had as

I was writing this article and that was

made possible because I have all of

these notes on not taking I've done so

much deep thinking on not taking but I'm

also a a a tech worker I'm a devops

engineer and I almost wanted to say a

programmer but I'm not a professional

programmer yet but I was able to pull in

this note about the Unix philosophy into

this because I had done the thinking

about it earlier and I could place it

and I I could try it out like does this

fit and I thought yeah this actually

fits really well so you can experiment

you can I could have pulled in a note

about I don't know cooking or how spices

can can

um uh unexpectedly strengthen other

tastes I don't know I'm just making this

up but you can everybody is unique

everybody has their own unique interests

and everybody will have their own unique

not taking Sy systems and they would

pull them in in their in their own

unique way leading to very creative new

ideas so with these notes the they

become building blocks they can be

rearranged and one thing that I use this

for actually I will just briefly show

this before I I end the video because

it's already getting a bit long but I do

want to uh highlight this um

let's see one way that you can use this

is this so this is the canvas that I

used for creating my ttle Casas

course and if you don't know I have a

course on the ttle Casten method it has

now over 1100 students and I believe

it's one of the best resources on the

tle cast method on the internet I'm

getting really high reviews you can

purchase it on UD to me or you can

choose to enter my school Community it

is $35 a month but then you get access

to all of my courses on not taking and

you have access to the community where

you can ask questions to fellow not

takers or me directly you can join the

Q&A calls and it's a great way to to

accelerate your own notetaking journey

and to connect with other fellows in the

tech industry

so this course was created by pulling in

all of my different notes and creating a

canvas like this I use this to create

the overall structure of the the the

ttle cast and course so here is the here

is some of the structure like what is a

tle cast well I have a note about that

and I have a note about how it was

invented by Nicholas Lumen that he was

the master of his craft and all of these

notes are individually crafted to

Perfection and here I would have another

concept like how the settle Casten

method improves

productivity and here I go into actually

writing the notes how to take notes

writing is thinking fleeting notes so I

use this to

actually create a a larger structure out

of all of these notes that I had and

this process by itself caused me to

refine each of these notes and to do

very deep thinking about this so here is

an whole area about the settle Casten

lifestyle that I that I um this

philosophy that I created about it that

I explain in detail in my course but

that you see yourself as a factory with

input and output and how you should

limit your input in order to generate

quality output so

these tools like obsidian allow you to

take out all of these well-crafted notes

arrange them experiment with them create

connections between them and play with

them and this has been a massive massive

accelerator in my own

thinking so this is what I think allows

of a for a very effective way of

thinking and handling your

notes I think this is one of the ways

how the the ttle cast method actually

makes you more productive because you

spend quality time with each

note you can reuse

your note so that is really important

this makes you really productive because

if you do the having lifting once then

you don't have to think about it the

next time when you do it so when you

have a large collection of well flashed

out ideas you can create very easily you

can create many different articles by

combining the same elements into

different unique orders so re recycling

makes one very productive you recycle

your own thinking your own effort and

then um lastly there is this visual

aspect of it where you break out a note

and you allow yourself to be sucked into

that note and there is an element of the

ability of focus and being able to stick

to one idea for a certain period of time

and really give it the quality attention

to craft something beautiful out of it

so this is one aspect of why I think the

ttle castle method makes you more

productive I highly recommend you try it

out and check out my course if you want

to know more or join my school Community

it is seriously the best way to learn

this so thank you for your attention and

I hope to see you in the next video
