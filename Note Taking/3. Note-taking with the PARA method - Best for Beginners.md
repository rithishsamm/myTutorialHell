hello there my name is Misha I'm a devops engineer and a master of not taking and today I'm going to show you the para method by Thiago Forte so when I first dived into note taking systems I was like so overwhelmed 
and confused I tried bullet journaling the Cornell method uh later I um encountered the P method and then I moved on to the ttle cast method and I tried all of these methods and several more 

I won't list them all um I've tried them all and I have thousands of hours of no taking and research under my belt using these systems so I feel like I'm in a position where I can make some genuine recommendations that come from experience and not some YouTube kid who reads an article right so I want you to start a note taking system that suits you that fits so I'm going to give you also a few sets of principles and pitfalls with this method and I'm going to also explain why I think this method is good for beginners so don't this video is going to save you a lot of time if you watch it till the end so after all of these thousands of hours of not taking and trying out

I recommend two methods the para method and the Zettelkasten method here we are going to to focus on the basics of the par method why it's suitable for beginners and um how to use it effectively and then next week we're going to look into the Zettelkasten method so the para method is created by Thiago Forte and it was done in his book um building a second brain this is a

this is a brain and it's going building the your second brain and that's a  really good book I really recommend it I'll leave a l link down below and what's interesting is that it's not just about noes this building a second brain is more like a larger productivity system and thus the par method is not only a method for note taking it's not just for writing what's cool about the par method is that it serves as an an overall structure for your entire life and for your thinking so it it it it's not only about notes it's also actually how you um think about your time how you divide up your time how you prioritize your tasks it's a really interesting method  and this is also why I recommend it for beginners as one of the reasons 

because it's it's one of of the first attempts if you're coming to this world to the productivity World completely unstructured this is going to be one of the attempts to actually start categorizing things and and doing things in a more intentional way so the para acronym stands for projects areas uh resources and the archive that's what the p a a acronym stands for and I'm going to dive into each of these um elements one by one so 

let's start with the project so if you've heard of uh getting things done GTD by David Allen you might have come across this definition of a project but in there a project is defined as any that requires the completion of multiple tasks in order to achieve a certain outcome so whenever you have more than one task that you need to complete that is all contributing towards a single goal a single desired outcome that is a project and usually projects have a a a short time Horizon and it's usually about 12 maximum 12 12 months but in my own system 

I usually see projects like two three months that kind of thing so it's like I I try to scope them very small so it could be building a PC it could be planning a holiday planning a vacation setting up a Blog that kind of thing where it has a clear end state that is a project now in the para method a project is simply a folder that you can collect notes in this is like a folder and

this is will be your project so it's very similar to the the classic way of managing projects right if you were to buy a house then if you are  organized then you would buy a folder like this this oops this paper um folder that you have that's where the the the word folder comes from so this this folder paper folder that holds other papers like a not even a binder but just to fold it around so in that folder you would then collect like all of the contracts for the new house and you go to several different mortgage providers and they all give you documentation they all give you flyers and all that stuff and  you collect all of that in this this single folder and every time you sit down to work on this project 

you are performing work on buying a house you would sit down you would take that folder and then you have all of the information ready Avail readily available for you it's all spread out  for you so

that this  is like the classic way of collecting information and you're able to carry it around and that is more of the like the the paper age and it is a very effective way of doing it so a project like we said is a set of tasks to desire certain outcome and like a few examples would be to plan a vacation so I really love hiking so I'm going to draw a horrible drawing of a

shoe this represents vacation to me and then in order to plan that vacation there are several tasks so I would have to research destinations and I would have to book a flight and um you would have to create a packing list all of that research the correct gear so these are all tasks that are all contributing to this one project je of a holiday or another one would be to launch a Blog right say you want to launch a Blog on the internet and 

then you need to choose a platform like are you going for substack or WordPress or maybe going for self-hosted with Yugo you will need to figure out a design or a theme uh you have to write your first post all that kind of stuff so these are all and when you are like researching the platform then you will collect all of this information like the links that you 
find on the internet all of the links are being stored in this this folder uh you will find um you will start writing notes like you are actually writing notes on the research like when you come across substack then you would write a note to your yourself what you think of it what you don't like about it all of that lives in the project folder and is is gathered

there so next we would have areas now areas are different from projects because they um entail something that you are responsible for over a longer period of time it involves an ongoing engagement or responsibility so by definition it's going to play a significant role in your life it's a very important thing in your life so an example of areas with responsibilities would be uh well the house right 

this is a house and then you need to paint the house you need to do gardening and Landscaping you have to mow the lawn all of these responsibilities come with a house secondly it could be your health like then you would have to have an exercise routine like Fitness or running and you need to have a good diet like a health is a big area could be family like maintaining family relationships all of that and all of these activities like for your house 

you will take notes on how your uh I don't know permaculture in your garden right or when you should sew these types of of seeds um what the best paint options are for your particular Building Material all those kinds of things you can gather in these areas so when you when it's time to look at your notes then you know exactly where to go you go to the area of the the house and then you figure out the then you find the painting note and from there there are linked notes that have to do with painting uh so areas are like like I said it's a project is different from an area because a project is about like 3 to 12 months and it has a a a defined end goal but an area doesn't have an end goal it's just a something that goes on and on 

that you is significant in your life and that you are expecting to spend a lot of time on and take a lot of notes on by distinction now notice that this project of buying a house that we discussed earlier can then transition into an area like you start with a project of building of buying a house and then when that is completed then the project transitions to an area so you would move you would have your projects folder and  here you would have the house project and here is the areas folder where you have like family and and other things

well what you would do is then you would take the house project and move it to the area because it's sort of graduate us to area status that's how this organization would work and 

now you can start seeing how this philosophy this this para method can can really help you to structure structure your thinking because suddenly you have this distinction between short-term projects and long-term areas and to me that was super helpful like I was just going about it like randomly
and this it was all jumbled and this extin this distinction of a long-term engagement versus a shortterm set of tasks was very useful to me in the beginning uh resources then resources uh

resources these are simply collections of information which you expect to be useful in the future so these are all used for reference so it's not necessarily tied to a project it's just a hobby that you have uh you you can be into like indoor vegetable gardening or you can be into a game and then you collect all of the the the guides build guides and all of that all of that stuff you can collect in this uh Diablo 2 folder for example so all of that all of those notes you come across during your content consumption or like links you come across all of this stuff you gather that in resources so it's not useful at this very moment but you expect it to be useful in a in the future time so you can easily find them later so some examples of uh resources in my power system is like uh Microsoft Azure go kubernetes but also like weight loss and uh writing let's a resource I always collect things about writing so indoor vegetable growing these are just like interests that you have hobbies that you are researching often and then you come

across things you write notes about them and then you store them all in these respective containers or folders and then finally there is the archive 
archive so and this is uh where you place notes which are not useful currently or in the near future but you don't really want to throw them away  either and what's great about an archive is that in a system like obsidian then you will start searching for notes um like unrate you you when you're searching for certain notes and then suddenly you come across a note of like three years ago and 

you had totally forgotten about that note but all of a sudden that that idea or that that that concept that you have spelled out in that note suddenly becomes super relevant and you make a connection that is totally unexpected so instead of deleting notes it's much better to keep them in an archive so that they will come up with searching and you can make these unexpected con connections with notes so I I recommend not deleting notes unless you are certain that this is not useful for your system at all keep them in the archive and also like in tools like obsidian it is possible to exclude certain directories from your searches so even if you like if if you um are bent on not seeing your notes in the archive then you can always exclude that from your search um so the implementation of this

in terms of a not taking system is very simple you will have a directory structure so the way I do that um let's see you can see it here yeah here is my my vim and this is like an example Vault that I created so here I would have an inbox I highly recommend inbox I'll go into that later but then I do projects areas resources archive and notice that I use numbering because the para is not in alphabetical order so on Unix systems this is a nice way of actually um making sure that the area the the order is in the order that you want you could also move the inbox to number number five that's what you like better so you create this this directory structure and then you um then you start placing your notes in there so in obsidian how it works is that it's just a file system on your disk and

this is why I recommend this is why I recommend  obsidian like I've said in the previous video because then you have your local markdown files on your on your system and you can then place these in like a project folder and you have other notes about your house or these can all go into the the house area because each of these folders would have their subfolders
 
 and that's how you would have like your house area your family area and your volunteer work area these would be the project of starting a blog and building a PC all of them have these subfolders and then when you are done with the building a Blog um project then you would move that to the archive for example or to an area so you you move these things around after you're done with them so this is the implementation of para in a not taking system 
 
 but you can also like if you have like a bookmark manager for example well in there you can also start Gathering these the stuff in these categories you can if you have physical notes if you have a bookcase or if you have like um physical notes that you use that you write in or your notebooks you can you can make this para distinction into everything you do and that's what I like about the para method especially for beginners now about the inbox that I showed you inbox this is a concept that I've been testing a lot over the years like I I I didn't really like that idea of an inbox in the beginning and I then I had an inbox and I did it away with it tried for a few months and it was back and 
 
 now after SE now that I've mastered my system now I have settled that inbox is the way to go you need to have an inbox so what you do with your inbox is that you will be capturing your notes while you're on the go then you have this low friction way of capturing notes and this will stimulate you to do more notes to create to write more notes if it's a low friction way if it's you're reading a book you have your notebook for example or you have your phone with obsidian on it and you have an interesting idea you create a note it's in the Inbox and 
 
 it's done it's out of your mind and this will start to get you into this Noe taking habit and that is a very useful method of working but it does require
discipline because ideally once a day but at least several times a week you will have to sit down at your desk calmly and and sit down with your computer and then you start processing these notes then you have to start then you put them in all your different projects and in your area and 

sometimes you will find notes in your inbox that at the time seemed interesting and and useful but then later you think nah I don't really need that so you delete that note right so it it's a some it's it's an extra layer of thought on your notes which is very useful I some I very often delete notes from my inbox because they don't seem useful at all anymore but this in idea of an inbox where you can capture notes quickly on the go and then you process them later is a very powerful thing and I highly recommend you you do this 

so why do I recommend the para method for beginners Well if you're completely new to note taking and and and productivity systems then the par method is a great place to start because it's an excellent framework for both your your writing your note taking and your thinking your brain here so it's it's like I mentioned earlier in the video it's not just about notes it's actually a method of bringing some structure to your whole life it's a frame of thinking and that's why I like about the para method and 

why I also recommend it to beginners if you're completely new to  notetaking and productivity and living life with intention basically instead of just going from paycheck to paycheck and from recommended YouTube video to recommended YouTube video because the power method will force you to sit down and think well what projects am I actually working on so when I started out this was super helpful to divide this to make this division between projects and areas it really helped me to get a clear picture of my priorities I had all these  projects in my head and I would just be doing stuff randomly in the moment that I as I felt felt um that suited best for the moment and each of them had like this explosion of Unfinished tasks that was all in my mind but when I sat down and I started really thinking about well what what is actually important like what are my areas what are the the the most important things in my life and 

I came up with a lot of areas and then I thought well maybe I need to cut a few of these out because uh I need to focus on the other ones so in my my particulars uh I'll tell you a little bit of a story about myself but when I started out and I wanted to make a career change to devops 

music was a very important area in my life I I play guitar I sing I play the piano but all this stuff takes several hours a day of practice and it's fun but at that moment I I really made a conscious Choice like okay it's an important area in my life but my career is an even more important area in my life at this moment so I cut out music from my life and I saved thousands of hours a year because

I don't have to do that practice anymore and I'll will pick it up later but now at this point this area needed to be put into the archive for a bit cuz remember archive is not something permanent right you can archive something and you can take it out from the archive so that was really useful and then this distinction between projects and areas was also super useful like what are the short-term things oh that's a very bad writing but 

okay so what are the short term things which projects am I actually  working on like I was like building a home lab and and Arch Linux and and I was studying for certifications and I did it all like M jumble around in in random order but really think about like what is my project what is the goal that I want to achieve what is the the desired outcome and then what are the tasks that are needed to achieve this desired outcome and really sit down and divide them up and t

his is why power is so powerful Beyond just a notetaking system because if you're new to this this is going to be super useful to actually get some structure in your thinking and your life and then secondly I I think we are as human beings we are somehow naturally inclined to divide things up into folders and directories we like at least I think most people like to have categories for things and to split things up and to put things into their correct category into their correct place and 

the para method is a great way to start it feels natural to separate things and like this putting notes in certain categories is significant in the beginning but as you become more uh Advanced as your note taking becomes more advanced you have done it for a year or so and uh you become more mature in your note taking then then it becomes less significant it becomes less significant to to do this uh stuff and in the ttle cast method which we will discuss next week there is no such structure everything lives in just one big directory with all of your notes in there

and then all of these notes are linked among each other with a system of identifiers or markdown links in obsidian so there's no way of pulling out  the vacation project in a folder like you might be used to so that is why I I recommend para first because this can be a very daunting Prospect at least for me it was like completely une  earthly to put everything in one one folder and then somehow expect to be able to to reach your notes 

but we'll get into that in the next videos can be very daunting and it's it's most important to get started quickly the most important thing is to start taking notes so when you start implementing the par method I will share some principles and pitfalls like things to watch out for but before I do that I just wanted to show you that I have a uh course on the obsid on obsidian 
101 UD me course referral links so here is my link for the course and if you go to this course um on udemy this is a full not taking system in 1 hour it's uh like now it's like 14.99 UD me controls these devices it's super cheap um it's already

getting five star reviews 115 people have bought it so it's it's it's not just one review right it's it's it's proper proper rating and this goes over the par method especially in terms of not taking but it shows you a complete inbox workflow how to set everything up with uh correct key bindings so this channel is called living on the command line so of course we are interested in doing everything with our keyboard so everything is set up in with the mindset

of doing as much as possible with your keyboard and uh this is actually a great way to get started with the power method in obsidian takes you one hour and then you have a fully functional no taking System including backing it up to G so it's a very good thing and uh you can also consider joining my school Community because then you get access to all of my courses unlimited access U I have several courses on you can start watch my settle cast method you can watch my course on uh all of these other courses on kubernetes how to maximize your salary

uh config management there's so much here goal setting in obsidian 

it's a very important course that uh many of my students have liked very much and this is currently $30 a month the price is going to increase fairly soon so this is a great way to get in because if you get in for a price then you will always keep paying the price regardless if I raise it and here you get access to the community where we have three weekly q&as you can get direct access to me 

where you can ask questions about not taking you can ask questions about your software engineering devops career and there's already 20 pages of topics here that you can search all about obsidian Vim no taking and it's just a massive Hub of knowledge so check it out you're going to get the most value if you choose to go for the school membership so now let's um go for some principles and pitfalls when implementing the para method um first one is U let's see here Zen mode the first one is make decisions

quickly so when you're processing your inbox don't sit there and thinking for five minutes like is this note should be in my project or is it more suited in this area or should it rather be there no don't go fall into that rabbit hole if you're processing your notes it should take maybe three seconds to like okay this belongs to this project oh this belongs to this area and it doesn't matter if it's out of place if it's the wrong location later when you're working with your notes you can always move them back later

but it's just a this is something that I did in the beginning I was sort of agonizing over these decisions and that is something to U look out for the second Pitfall is uh avoid moving files around all the time so it can be really tempting to sort of Click through all of your your folders and see what notes are in there and then you start thinking well maybe this one is much better placed in my home maintenance area instead of a gardening project note right it can be super tempting to do this kind of stuff it feels like productivity but actually it is false productivity 

false productivity this is something you have to look out for like in general sometimes these activities feel like you're doing interesting work work that is conducive to contributing your goals and I've fallen into this trap that's why I'm telling you this but it can feel like a productive session but it's not it's not it's not productive at all so avoid moving F files around just when

you're processing them put them in the correct project or area maybe consider moving like a project to an an area later And archiving an area or a project like at like I suggest it should go from the inbox to a project or area and then to the archive that should be the the maximum of of file movements like maybe one movement here but if you do more than that then you know that you are doing too much of this um let's see um next related to this is that uh your not taking should improve your productivity it should make you more time efficient should make it possible to achieve more in a shorter time so

if you find yourself agonizing over these node locations if you find yourself you're spending a lot of time on making these decisions then reflect like maybe the par method is not the right system for you maybe you are not suited to

dividing these up into categories and you are more suited to the settle custom method or something completely different like if you if your not taking system is slowing you down significantly then reflect and of course it will take some time to get started right like when you start using you build this system with the principles I give View and then it takes time to get into it of course like give it a few months give it like half a year to get really get rolling but if you constantly feel it's like actually making you slower then  maybe a different method is better for  you and uh your productivity system should always make you more productive so um this is what I had to share about the para method today um there are like I I recommend this to beginners because it helps you with uh thinking overall and 

it's a more it's a good um way of approaching life but also there is a lot of uh resources available around this on the internet you can check out Thiago Forte's book building a second brain but there are tons of Articles tons of YouTube videos like I've told you everything you need to know but if you have a desire to verify what I told you is true or if you want to have more information then there's tons of material available out there so that is also an advantage of the power method that it's well established and that material is easily available but yeah um check out my course or my School Community or if you want to do it on your own way start with these para directories start putting notes in them and then have an inbox and have an inbox workflow and start with that and see how it feels for you don't think too much about it just do it and then next week we're going to look into the Zettelkasten cast method so thank you very much for watching and hope to see you in the next one
