**Note-taking Tools and Apps,**

Here, we're going to explore the different available note taking tools and apps. I'm going to explain to you which one I have chosen and why 

and I'm basically going to tell you everything you need to know, to make your informed decision 

I recommend you do so to watch my previous one that fully explains the benefits of note taking and how it can improve your career 

Let's get started when I started my not taking journey.
I was overwhelmed with all of the options available and 
making decisions is one of the most draining tasks we can do as human beings 

and

I've done the work 
I've spent several 100 hours trying many tools Building Systems into them 
breaking them down and 

I'm going to share with you everything I know about this 
so I can save you hundreds of hours if you just watch this video to the end 
**so what what are we looking for in a note taking system?**
there are so many options but let's actually get into 
**what we need in a note taking system?** 
**what are we actually looking for?** 
there are basically two categories of note taking apps in my opinion,
	there are the the 
###### **Simple ones** - like Apple notes or other applications ,
where all you do is just 
create a note 
you store it there and that's it.  
you save it for later, 
you write your shopping lists there, 
you do very simple tasks in there.
*it's just a collection of notes like my Google Drive with Google docs on there*. that's also a very simple not taking apps not taking tool 

###### Advanced - which can be systems
these are apps that go beyond storage 
these are the apps that make it possible 
- to create links between notes to um 
- visualize your notes 
- to have tags on your notes and 
- pull them out, 
these are the the apps that go beyond just making a note and storing it and saving it for later 

and even though you can do incredible things with these simple apps like apple notes there are people who build entire Zettelkasten in apple notes. We want to build a system where 
- we can store our notes but 
- we also need to be able to retrieve those notes with lightning speed 

like previously said that, 
the ability to retrieve information from your system depends on
- the structure that you have and 
- the ability or to search 
- the ability to know where to look in your system
- the ability to have and do the same with an intention 
*-and you can do that in a simple app but an advanced app is going to make that a lot **easier** for you* because it has more **advanced functionality** 

in this advanced setup, we need several functions:
TLDR:  we need to be able to
 - link notes 
 - search
 - visualize links/notes
 - Accessibility from anywhere
 FUNCTIONS:
- we need the ability to **link notes together** so 
- we need to be able to **indicate relationships between notes** 
- we need to be able to **visualize how these notes relate to each other** *this is very important for thinking* and 
- we need a good search functionality to be able to **search**
-  we need the ability to **visualize our links or notes** in some way 
- we need to be able to **visual things with your notes**
- we need the ability to **access our note taking system from anywhere**, from portable devices  
- we need the ability to **live and cope up with the command line interface** and functionality. 

```TEXT
note: 
VISUALIZING:
visualizing things activates different parts of your brain and like I'm not an artist I don't see bright pictures when I close my eyes but still I utilize **creating pictures and images to facilitate memory and to be able to memorize things more quickly**. **==if you create a picture about something in your mind you're much likely to remember it==**

and that is actually going 
- to improve your understanding and 
- your thinking 
> This is why the Zettelkasten method is so incredibly effective, because originally 

you would have these paper index cards where you write on ->  you put those in a box -> then when it comes the right time to write an article -> you can take all these cards out and -> put them on the table and -> you can spread them around and -> you can actually visually play with the ideas -> you can visually put them together -> you can visually put them in different orders and -> see how they relate to each other.

 Zettelkasten -> This is super powerful in thinking so we need to **ability to visualize things** = powerful.  
-------------------------------------------------------

ACCESSIBILITY:
 ideally we will be able to access our notes from our phone,cause,
yeah 
- we are out and about 
- we're sitting on the bus 
- > we want to make a note / have a system where we can access the notes that we already have or add a note there or 
- when you're on holiday and
- you're walking in the mountains and 
- > you have this super important Insight, you need to be able to capture that somehow

-------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND LINE INTERFACE:
as  a command line focused engineer, there are some other requirements that we need to consider:

```

###### COMMAND LINE INTERFACE SPECIALITY FUNCTIONALITIES:
as  a command line focused engineer, there are some other requirements that we need to consider:
TLDR:  we need to be able to
 - locally available text files
 - run scripts
 - use preferred text editors (vim, nano)
 - customize our editing and reading experience. 
 FUNCTION:
- locally available text files:
we want the ability to open our text files in `Vim` or in whatever editor that you prefer, having these text files on your machine, 
- then you're in charge of those and 
- you can modify your editing experience as you like it, and 
- we want the ability to run scripts on those files, **very important**
*if you have thousands of files and you want to make a bulk update, you don't want to rely on some sort of external thing. **you just write a script and do it*** 
- we want to like I said we want to uh use our preferred text editors (Elite Vim crew reporting in) and
- we want to customize our editing and reading experience

yes you can customize your experience in there but not to the degree where you can do things 

like, short hand commands and gestures convenience in Linux. like
v - to open Vim
l - to list
d - to print data in shell 
and more. 

I write if I do bang bang title then it's going to run a go program
a very simple go program that I wrote and 
put take that line of text feed it through the go program and 
replace this line in the editor with the program 

**this kind of stuff!** you want to do the the you want to have some customized experience right as a command line engineer 

you want to be able to create these little programs and do that for yourself 

**==so those are the focus areas for command line focused Engineers==** 


##### Tools tried
#### 1) Notion
**Pros:**
it's a very very good app. it is you can see here like entire companies are being run from notion. like it's not that they use these companies. well, they like these companies will use it, but there are entire companies that run all of their operations from notion project management and everything 

I built my first systems there. and it like I said, it can be a good place to start. because 
- you have a lot of templates available so 
- you can access the templates library and 
- they're going to be like full like writing blogging templates content calendars or whatever like project management templates 
- they can be very easy to start with those and 

what's also really cool about notion is that 
- you can create databases so you can create a database of notes and then
- you can have another database and you can link these databases with each other and 
- create relations between them and 
- you can back them up as you like
- you can do really cool stuff and 
I spent many an hour trying to come up with these insane project management systems which are totally over engineered for my sort of one man show of studying and becoming an engineer but still it was cool. it was fun.

so it's a very powerful place to start you can start for free but there are some problems with it.

**Cons:**
you can do incredible things with it but like I'm saying.

- it has a huge potential for distraction and tinkering and and
- just distraction so for this reason alone I I don't recommend notion anymore  
- there's simply too much YouTube available around it too and there's just going to be so much potential for distraction and 
- you're going to fall into the Trap the same trap that I did and that is that 
-  you start watching YouTube videos about note taking instead of actually taking notes instead of actually studying notes. but
-  the main problem with notion is that your files live in the cloud
- it's just a browser app and everything is in the app, not in your hands.
-  so there's no way to just go into the terminal and say and and `cd` into a directory and interact with your notes.
- so all of your notes are always in the cloud you,  
- can't run scripts on them 
- you cannot open them in your favorite text editor like `VIM` and 
- there's also the issue where notion employees can actually access your notes, if they have some reason to do that 
- if you are very hard on privacy and security focused guy, so 
- you will still having your entire note taking system, my Zettelkasten, my deepest Secrets all of that in a system in the cloud where employees can access it, maybe not if i leave. No, thank you! :)

#### 2) Evernote
**Pros:**
Evernote is pretty cool. because it combines 
- note taking 
- with to-do and 
- scheduling 
**so it is a yeah more of a second brain kind of type of app** 

this is the one that Thiago for uses or used a lot in his book building a second brain.

notion is free you can do most things free but if you want to collaborate which you probably won't need for your own system but then you have to pay,
and here Evernote probably it has some paid stuff as well oh here pricing here see personal so here 

**Cons:**
- there are like limits to how many notes you can take there 
- Note size
- Etc 
-> if you want a second brain um then you can consider Evernote 

	but the thing is we are not building a second brain,we are building a not taking system.

**Concept:**
Second Brain: a second brain is a bigger concept that spans many more things. it spans like 
- task management
- time management  
- emails 
so the second brain is sort of the overarching workflow, not just not taking. 

and I see note taking as a part of the second brain 
but it's a hugely important part
it's something that is this is where you need to start with

**you need to start with a good notetaking system**
so this is a very important distinction here like the 
Note taking system vs all of these other tools 

but we now we are fully concerned with note taking.
because that's the basis of everything. that's where we need to start!

#### 3) Roam Research
**Pros:**
 it looks like a very powerful tool
  it has a great ecosystem 
  it allows linking of notes visualization uh 

`so we are getting closer to our uh to our in our search for all of these requirements that we stated above.`

but Rome also didn't make the cut because if we open Rome research 

 this looks really cool 
 - you can create links 
 - you can visualize 

**Cons:**
 but again 
 - there is some pricing involved if you want all of the good stuff and again 
 - all of this lives in the cloud 
 - there's no way to open this in vim and 
of course that is really important so enter obsidian.

#### 4) Obsidian! (recommended choice)
**Pros:**
**obsidian** is the best tool because it literally ticks off all of these requirements
- uses markdown files on our machine 
- they are stored locally 
- there is all of these are markdown files that are here in my note taking system
- all of my files here are locally available on my machine 
- there's this concept of a vault and a vault is nothing more than a collection of markdown files and 
- obsidian is a way to to edit and 
- visualize markdown files but 
- it also allows you to do very powerful things with your files 
- let's see go out of this drawing because I'm doing this within obsidian 
- this is so cool I'm doing I'm drawing in obsidian itself but 
- I also can access my notes 

**Tut:**
Here. so if I uh let's see, 
- let's 1) create a new note and this is just the 2)name - demo 
- so 3) you can link notes by doing [[]]double brackets
- so like here 4) I'm linking to this drawing that I did and I don't know I'm just linking notes by
 ex:
```
[[filename]]
```
- this is how you can link notes and 
- if I then open the local graph, here 
- we see that these links, these links gets connected within files and 
- they are visualized in graph view 
- so we can link notes and 
- visualize them
if you do this over several years diligently and 
- you always link notes 
- to other notes 
- a graph emerges 
- that's going to look like A WEB OOF YOUR BRAIN THAT YOU DOCUMENTED.

###### **Notes Visualization using Graph:**
this obsidian graph, now all of these notes 
- they are linked together somehow and 
- there are also a few notes that are not linked yet but 
what's powerful about this is that,
- you can see these dots appear here, that have a lot of notes so here we see that this 
 dot -  **School**
-> apparently is very important thing in my in my not taking system 
-> you can visually see elements in your notE taking system that are important to you 
-> sometimes this leads to surprises like if over time. eg: 
Eg: a chapter that you noted or a big effort that you did has received a lot of links and apparently this has been or is a very important thing in my life or for you so that you can go recall the same. 

another way to vizualize notes is we can use canvas 
###### **Notes Visualization using Canvas:**
Literally a canvas. React Flow like UI connecting nodes and stuff. 
- I take all of these notes and 
- I move them around and 
- I put them in the right order and 
**this has been an extremely powerful way of structuring my own thoughts** 
so I could move these around like
- think well this fits much better there and 
- this one doesn't fit here so 
- it should be moved over there and 
**it's super powerful to to have the ability to play with your notes like this and create overviews** and then there's

###### **Extensions and Plugins: Excalidraw**
of course. Excalidraw where 
- I can even do insert any file and
- do the same as embeddable here yeah so
- I'm embedding this note like right click -> insert any file -> insert file name from vault ->  filename as embeddable. ->
- so now I've embedded this file ->  into this drawing and -> I can start like 
- Attach things 
- Create things 
- adding icons
this is also what I did in this massive drawing in this about my whole workflow I use excal draw in obsidian to visualize things 

I'm getting a bit distracted with the visualization stuff. so we can visualize 

###### **Search and sync Functionality**
Obsidian has great search functionality 
so let's see if you open this search,  you can see that you can search for
- path
- file
- tags 
- sections 
so it's really useful to find your notes quickly with lightning speed and 

it also allows you to sync notes across all of your devices 
so you can you can have the obsidian app on your phone 
you can open up your note taking system
if you have Apple devices you can use iCloud to sync your Vault between between devices 
so I store my Vault on my Mac 
I can open it on my iPhone and 
then Apple sync handles the syncing between these devices

there's also **obsidian sync** so say 
you are in a situation where you have a Macbook and 
you have a Linux laptop and 
you want your notes to be available at both 
you can either use git obsidian git and this is done I show you this in my obsidian 101 course 
or you can use obsidian sync this is a paid service it's like what is it uh obsidian Sync It's like $5 a month or something uh here $4 a month

I had this for like a year.
it's a nice way to support the project because I haven't even said this 
but obsidian is completely for **free**
no problem ing no 

you download the app and 
use it and
it's compatible with Vim


so 
- can search 
- we can link notes 
- we can run scripts because we have all of our markdown files available um 
- we can use Vim with our markdown files and therefore
- we can customize our editing and reading experience 
- everything is stored in markdown file files
- we can do anything we want with our files

so my no taking system is completely built as having obsidian as the bases 
base obsidian -> fully compatible with vim 

and it's important because there are going going to be situations where you are either going to have only access to the obsidian app.  
there are situations where you only have obsidian / command line, 

well if you choose this approach by taking the obsidian vault 
as the basis 
as the the overarching sort of framework for your notetaking system 

this allow you to have a lot of 
- flexibility and 
- portability 
of your entire no taking system 

so I recommend use obsidian the concept of an obsidian Vault and keep it compatible with vim and the other way around 

because there are also systems you can create with Vim only 
but those are not necessarily going to be fully compatible with obsidian 

um so yes this is super important!
because we stay in
- **full control of our files**
my my entire settle cast is almost one gig and 
this also contains images it contains some Excel files everything is in
there but it's mostly markdown files - 3,150 markdown files and
- I can do whatever I want with these files 
- this is my this is just a directory on my system and
- I can copy that and
- back it up to encrypt it and 
- back it up to wherever I want 
- I can distribute it wherever I want
- I back this up into git and 
- I can pull it wherever I am if I have my SSH key to my GitHub account 
- I can pull it in I can and have access to my notes wherever from the command line 
- I can run a container with my Zettlekasten in it 

so in this series we are also going to be like writing 
- when we were learning Bash one of the most fun things I did was to run create bash scripts to work with my Zettlekasten to work with my Note taking system

so if you want to be following with my sort of tutorial journeyfor the same.
- I highly recommend you don't use notion 
- but you use obsidian with markdown files and 
- we are going to be using Vim to interact with these files in combination with obsidian 
- we are going to be learning about no taking in both obsidian and Vim and 
- how to edit those 
- how to run scripts on those and 
- **it's just going to be a fun experience** 

if you do it this way and I'm not saying this, because I you you necessarily need to join this playlist Journey 

but it is basically just what I arrived at after 2,000 hours of researching and practicing the Zettelkasten method because that is what we are going to work towards is to build Zettlekasten + obsidian +neo vim like I have done in my course 


this all you need to get started 
- it will implement the para method for you and 
- you can start taking notes today because 
that's the most important thing here guys 
- stop watching videos 
- stop researching 
- just use obsidian and 
- start taking notes 
that's the most important thing so these are this course is my life's work it's 2,000 hours condensed in 2 hours and this is also a good course but if the best value honestly is just to join my school Community 

in conclusion,
- use obsidian 
- start taking notes today
- have it compatible with Vim in markdown files and
in the next video we're going to look into how to actually 
- start taking notes and which 
- methods we can use for taking notes in our obsidian 

Will catch up! 

Thanks!!
