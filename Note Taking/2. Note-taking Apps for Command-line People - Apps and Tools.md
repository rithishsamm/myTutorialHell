hello there my name is Misha I'm a devops engineer from the Netherlands and in this week's tutorial we're going to explore the different not taking tools and apps that are available I'm going to explain to you which one I have chosen and why and I'm basically going to tell you everything you need to know uh to make your informed decision so if you haven't watched my previous video in this series I recommend you do so it fully explains the benefits of not taking and 

how it can improve your career and the link will be down below and somewhere in the screen somewhere so let's get started when I started my not taking journey I was overwhelmed with all of the options available and making decisions is one of the most draining tasks we can we can do as human beings and I literally SP spend several hundred hours trying out these different tools because if you like Google not taking systems not taking apps I mean look at that 10 best not taking apps best no taking apps six best no taking apps like how how many apps are there right no taking apps it's it's just so much information and 

I've done the work I've spent several 100 hours trying many tools Building Systems into them breaking them down and I'm going to share with you everything I know about this so I can save you hundreds of hours if you just watch this video to the end so what what are we looking for in a not taking system well as you see there is a wall of blog posts here 

there are so many options but let's actually get into what we need in a not taking system what are we actually looking for so there are basically two categories of no taking apps in my opinion so there are the the simple ones simple like Apple notes or um these other applications where all you do is just create a note you store it there and that's it you you you save it for later you write your shopping lists there you do very simple tasks in there 

it's just a collection of notes like my my Google Drive with Google docs on there that's also a very simple not taking apps not taking tool but there are also apps that go beyond so th those are more advanced let's I won't write the whole world whole word but let's say advanced and these are apps that go beyond storage these are the apps that make it possible to create links between notes to um visualize your notes to have tags on your notes and 


pull them out these are the the apps that go beyond just making a note and storing it and saving it for later and even though you can do incredible things with these simp apps like apple noes there are people who build entire settle cast in apple noes we want to build a system where we can store our noes but we also need to be able to retrieve those notes with lightning speed and like I said in the previous video the ability to retrieve information from your system depends on the structure that you have and the ability or to search the ability to know where to look in your system all of that so you need to do this with intention and you can do that in a simple app but an advanced app is going to make that a lot easier for you

because it has more advanced functionality so what are we looking for in this Advanced uh in this advanced setup we need several functions and let 
me just switch to text here let's see so we need several functions we need the ability to link notes together so we need to be able to indicate relationships between notes we need to be able to visualize how these noes relate to each other this is very important for thinking and 

that's we will get into that in future videos or in my ttle cast course that is uh linked down below um we need the ability to link notes we need a good search functionality we need the ability to search we need the ability to visualize our links or notes in some way this is very important uh visualizing things activates different parts of your brain and like I'm not an artist I don't see bright pictures when I close my eyes but still I utilize creating pictures and images to um facilitate um memory and to be able to memorize things more quickly if you create a picture about something in your mind you're much likely to remember it

likewise if if you have the ability to visualize your notes in some way to to do visual things with your notes that is actually going to improve your understanding and your thinking this is why the settle cast method is so incredibly effective because originally you would have these paper index cards where you write on and you put those in a box and 

then when it comes to write time to write an article you can take all these cards out and put them on the table and you can spread them around and you can actually visually play with the ideas you can visually put them together you can visually um put them in different orders and see how they relate to each other this is super powerful in thinking so we need to ability to visualize things so we need to be able to link notes somehow search visualize them

next we also need the ability to access our no taking system from anywhere so accessibility and yeah from portable devices so ideally we will be able to access our notes from our phone because yeah we are out and about we're sitting on the bus we want to make a note well we want to have a system where we can access the notes that we already have or add a note there or when you're on holiday and

you're walking in the mountains and you have this super important Insight you need to be able to capture that somehow now as you are watching my channel and this playlist there is also a very high likelihood that you are a Linux devops software engineer uh interested kind of person who wants to 
learn more about work working on the command line like my channel is literally called living on the command line so as a command line focused engineer there are some other requirements that we need to consider we need to have oops here locally available text files that is something that we really need and why well because 

we want to we we want the ability to open our text files in in Vim in our or in whatever editor that you prefer like obviously I'm a Vim guy but if you have the text files on your machine then you're in charge of those and you can modify your editing experience as you like it so we want locally available text files we want the ability to run scripts on those files very important if you have thousands of files and you want to make a bulk update 

you don't want to rely on some sort of external thing no you just write a script and do it we want to like I said we want to uh use our preferred text editors text editors and then Elite Vim crew reporting in and we want to customize our editing and reading experience so these external tools that we're going to go through yes you can customize your experience in there but not to the degree where you can do things like um let's see do I have a terminal open yeah soorry if I go to my temp folder and if I just uh create a hello. MD markdown file if I press space DD then it's going to insert the the date here or space space YT or space 

Hy this is going to insert a short code and I just write the YouTube ID and then it's going to embed a YouTube video on my blog this kind of stuff right um or if I this is a title that I write if I do bang bang title then it's going to run a go program a very simple go program that I wrote and put take that
um line of text feed it through the go program and replace this line in the editor with the program this kind of stuff you want to do the the you want to have some customized experience right as a command line engineer 

you want to be able to create these little programs and do that for yourself so those are the focus areas for command line focused Engineers so locally available text files run scripts on the files use preferred text editors and customize our editing and reading experience now what options do we have what and basically what options did I try well one of the first ones is notion uh 

let's see this is one of the most um um how do you call it most popular tools out there and for a reason it's a very very good app it is you can see here like entire companies are being run from notion like it's not that they use these companies well they like these companies will use it but there are entire companies that run all of their operations from notion project management everything 

so it's a very powerful place to start you can start for free but there are some problems with it well I I spent eight months in notion and I built my first systems there and it like I said it can be a good place to start because you have a lot of templates available so you can access the templates library and they're going to be like full like writing blogging templates content calendars or whatever like project management templates they can be very easy to start with those and 

what's also really cool about notion is that you can create databases so you can create a database of notes and then you can have another database and you can link these databases with each other and create relations between them and you can do really cool stuff and I I spent many an hour trying to come up with these insane project management systems which are totally over engineered for my sort of one man show of studying and 

becoming an engineer but still it was cool it was fun you can do incredible things with it but like I'm saying it has a huge potential for distraction and tinkering and and just distraction so for this reason alone I I don't recommend notion anymore um there's simply too much YouTube available around it too there's too much productivity YouTube like all these big guys like Ali abdal Thiago Forte I think Forte now Forte doesn't use notion but they just enter notion in YouTube and there's just going to be so much potential for distraction and you're going to fall into the Trap the same trap that I did and that is that you start watching YouTube videos about note taking instead of actually taking notes instead of actually studying notes

so that's this whole video is trying to save you from that trap but the main problem with notion is that your files live in the cloud when you access notion you like you you log in and then it's just a browser app and everything is in the app so there's no way to just go into the terminal and say and and CD into a directory and interact with your notes that that it doesn't work that way so all of your notes are always in the cloud you can't run scripts on them you can back them up as you like uh you cannot open them in your favorite text editor VI and there's also the issue where notion employees can actually access your notes

if they have some reason to do that so in like I used to be very hard on privacy not so much anymore but still having my entire not taking system my settle cast my deepest Secrets all of that in a system in the cloud where employees can access it maybe not so next in the list we have Evernote Evernote this is the one that Thiago for uses or used a lot in his book building a second brain and Evernote is pretty cool because it combines not taking with to-do and scheduling so it is a yeah more of a second brain kind of type of app and it's like I actually never used Evernote I considered it I maybe I created an account but again 

here already we see that uh like notion is free you can do most things free but if you want to collaborate which you probably won't need for your own system but then you have to pay and here Evernote probably it has some paid stuff as well oh here pricing here see personal so here there are like limits to how many notes you can take there is um Note size Etc so it already has some pricing there too yeah wow so you can create up to 50 notes okay well that's like I didn't know 

I didn't even know that but that's something to consider um when you make your decision uh my settle cast is 3,100 notes just so you know so if you're looking for a tool that allows you to build a second brain I'm going to do a horrible attempt at drawing a brain here so this is brain if you want a second brain um then you can consider Evernote but the thing is we are not building a second brain we are building a not taking system and 

a second brain is a bigger concept that spans many more things it it spans like task management it spans time management uh emails this kind of stuff so the second brain is sort of the overarching workflow not just not taking and I see not taking as a part of the second brain but it's a hugely important part it's something that is this is where you need to start with you need to start with a good notetaking system so this is a very important distinction here like the not taking system ver versus all of these other tools and we're going to get into that later I'm I will speak about second brain not in this video but in the next playlist this is going to uh I

'm going to show you my productivity system but we now we are fully concerned with note taking because that's the basis of everything that's where we need to start next there is uh Rome research Rome and I briefly considered it it looks like a very powerful tool it has a great ecosystem it allows linking of notes visualization uh 

so we are getting closer to our uh to our in our search for all of these requirements that we stated above but Rome also didn't make the cut because if we open Rome research here um this looks really cool you can create links you can visualize them like we are getting close in our requirements but again there is some pricing involved if you want all of the good stuff and again all of this lives in the cloud there's no way to open this in vim and 

of course that is really important so enter obsidian this is the tool to go this is like the horrible attempt at the obsidian logo which looks like this here that's my attempt at the logo here we go maybe I can just copy it here so much better so enter obsidian 

obsidian is what I arrived at after years of experimentation years obsidian is the best tool because it literally ticks off all of these requirements uh that we have here so obsidian uses markdown files on our machine they are stored locally so if I go to my settle Casten here you see like there's a ton of files here but if I open it in vim and if I enter settle cast and here

there is all of these are markdown files that are here in my in my in my not taking system this is my obsidian Vault that I can open in Vim so all of my files here are locally available on my machine an obsidian Vault so in in obsidian there's this concept of a vault so when you open obsidian you're opening a vault a and a vault is nothing more than a collection of markdown files and obsidian is a way to to edit and visualize markdown
files but it also allows you to do very powerful things with your files so if

I uh let's see go out of this drawing because I'm I'm doing this within obsidian right this is so cool I'm doing I'm drawing but I also can access my notes Here so if I uh let's see let's create a new note and this is just the
demo demo so you can link notes by doing double brackets so like here I'm I'm linking to this drawing that I did and maybe this reminds me of the tle cast in obsidian course that I created I don't know I'm just linking notes this is how you can link notes and if I then open the local graph local graph

here here we see that these links now they are um these notes have now these links and they are visualized so we can link noes and visualize them if you do this over several years diligently and you always link noes to other noes a graph emerges that's going to look like this so my system is 3,100 goes currently 3,148 you can see it down here in the bottom here and this is my obsidian graph now all of these notes they are linked together somehow and there are also a few notes that are not linked yet but 

what's powerful about this is that you can see these dots appear here that have a lot of notes so here we see that this dot called School apparently is very important thing in my in my not taking system well that's correct because school is my my passion project here there's another one like this note was called cks 

This is weight loss like you can see you can visually see elements in your not taking system that are important to you and sometimes this leads to surprises like if over time something let's see yeah here like apparently this ckss note has received a lot of links and apparently this has been or is a very important thing in my life well it is this certified kubernetes security expert was a big effort that I did so this is one way of visualizing notes another way is we can use canvas so um 

let's see we have the settle cast and course convas uh let's see settle confus here this is a convas that I created to create my tle Casten course so I take all of these notes and I move them around and I put them in the right order and this has been an extremely powerful way of structuring my own thoughts when creating this course so I could move these around and think well this fits much better there and this one doesn't fit here so it should be moved over there and it's super powerful to to have the ability to play with your notes like this and create overviews and then there's of course excal draw where I can even do like uh uh let's see insert any file and

let's see can I insert uh Lumen uh as embeddable here yeah so now I'm I'm embedding this oops now I'm embedding this note like insert any file Lumen as embeddable so now I've embedded this file into this drawing and I can start like attaching things Crea creating things adding icons this is also what I did in this massive drawing in this video that I created with 160,000 views now about my whole neovim workflow I use excal draw in obsidian to visualize things but okay I'm I'm

I'm getting a bit distracted with the visualization stuff the PO is across this is very um important so we can visualize obsidian allows you uh to to uh obsidian has great search functionality so let's see if you open this here you can see that you can search for path file tags sections so it's really useful to find your notes quickly uh with lightning speed and it also allows you to sync notes across all of your devices so you can you can have the obsidian app on your phone you can open up your not taking system

um if you have an i if you have Apple devices you can use iCloud to sync your Vault between between devices so I store my Vault on my Mac I can open it on my iPhone and then Apple sync handles the syncing between these devices there's also obsidian sync so say you are in a situation where you have a Macbook and you have a Linux laptop and you want your notes to be available at both you can either use git obsidian git and this is done I show you this in my obsidian 101 course or you can use obsidian sync this is a paid service it's like what is it uh obsidian Sync It's like $5 a month or

something uh here $4 a month I I I had this for like a year it's a nice way to support the project because I haven't even said this but obsidian is completely for free no problem ing no you download the app and use it and it's compatible with Vim so can search we can link notes we can run scripts because we have all of our markdown files available um we can use Vim with our markdown files and therefore we can customize our editing and reading experience everything is stored in markdown file files we can do anything we want with our files so my no taking system is completely built as having obsidian as the bases base obsidian and 

then have it fully compatible with vim and it's important because there are going going to be situations where you are either going to have only access to the obsidian app for example on your phone like it's possible to use fim on an iPhone but I don't recommend it so there are situations where you only have obsidian or there are situations where you only have the command line well if you choose this approach by taking the obsidian vault as the basis as the the overarching sort of framework for your notetaking system this allow you to have a lot of flexibility flexibility and portability of your entire no taking system 

so I recommend use obsidian the concept of an obsidian Vault and keep it compatible with vim and the other way around because there are also systems you can create with Vim only but those are not necessarily going to be fully compatible with obsidian um so yes this is super important because we stay in full control of our files my my entire settle cast is almost one gig and this also contains images it contains some Excel files everything is in there but it's mostly markdown files three 3,150 markdown
 files and I can do whatever I want with these files this is my this is just a  directory on my system and
 
  I can copy that and back it up to encrypt it and back it up to wherever I want I can distribute it wherever I want I back this up into git and I can pull it wherever I am if I have my SSH key to my GitHub account I can pull it in I can and have access to my notes wherever from the command line I can run a container with my ttle Casten in it I containerized my ttle Casten so in this series we are also going to be like writing when we were learning Bash one of the most fun things I did was to run create bash scripts to work with my ttle cast to work with my Nott taking system

so if you want to be following with my sort of tutorial journey into Linux in 
into containers I highly highly recommend you don't use notion but you use obsidian with markdown files and we are going to be using Vim to interact with these files in combination with obsidian but we are going to be learning about no taking in both obsidian and Vim and how to edit those how to run scripts on those and it's just going to be a fun experience 

if you do it this way and I'm not saying this because I you you necessarily need to join this playlist Journey but it is basically just what I arrived at after 2,000 hours of researching and practicing the settle cast method because that is what we are going to work towards is to build a tle cast invm obsidian like I have done in my course so if you're interested in learning more about the tett C method I highly recommend you either uh look into this course this has been is already getting five star reviews and and already have 24 students getting a lot of positive feedback on that just yesterday someone was shouting it out on LinkedIn super nice but there is also the obsidian 101 course and

if you check out this course this will show you a it's a a quick start you get  full not taking system in one hour so it's it's super cheap it's all you need to get started it will implement the para method for you and you can start taking notes today because that's the most important thing here guys stop watching videos stop researching just use obsidian and start taking notes that's the most important thing so these are this course is my life's work it's 2,000 hours condensed in 2 hours and this is also a good course but if the best value honestly is just to join my school Community 

because if you join my school Community then you are going to get unlimited access to all of my courses it's currently $29 there's a price increase coming soon and it's $29 a month it's $1 less than $1 a day and then you get unlimited access to all of my courses about Vim neovim my entire dot files walk through my kubernetes fundamentals course everything is in here including the two courses that I just showed you about not taking and there is a community of people of fellow not takers who are there to help you myself included and there is already like 540 pages of knowledge here that you can search by searching obsidian for example you can get all of the PO the posts on obsidian here and also

we you we have weekly Q&A calls three times a week there is a one-hour call with me and the community where you have the ability to ask questions and every day we have a few study hall a few hours where you can gather and take notes together and work on your certifications so that was it for this video in conclusion use obsidian start taking notes today have it compatible with Vim in markdown files and in the next video we're going to look into how to actually start  taking notes and which methods we can use for taking notes in our obsidian fold thank you so much for watching see you in the next one.
