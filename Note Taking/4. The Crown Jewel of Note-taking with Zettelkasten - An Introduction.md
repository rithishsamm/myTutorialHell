In German, Zettel means Notes and Kasten means Boxes. Meaning, note box, gathering small notes in boxes. 

Will see the History, Approaches and Techniques. 

This method gives benefits such as Maximizing Flexibility, Interconnectivity, increasing comprehension and recall. Gives web like network of info that you learnt, the efficient and enhanced locate, identifying and retrieval of information. Holistic insights with better memory. 

Enables creative sparks, wider creative sparks with the help of the access to your collected references. 

The idea behind Zettelkasten is that the recall of one to one correspondence of follow to pick information from wherever it got stored. 
and retrieve what you had. Also, its counter intuitive because in the hindsight, it seems scattered, clumsy and chaotic that is to get lost in the abyss even if 1000s of those got packed and sorted nicely. BUT, IT IS QUITE AND STRAIGHT OPPOSITE. 

It creates knowledge. Expands knowledge. Creates Long term memory.  
Enables to use space repetition in a manner. It also reduces information overload and overwhelm despite having thousands of these information. 

Using this strategically, you will end up having end up having a structured framework for capturing, process, filtering prioring certain aspects of the information that you capture. 

History - 20's Niklas Luhmann - system that connects vast amount of info and accommodate ideas. This was inspired by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz - The pre-zettelkastan example. 




hello my name is Misha I'm a devops

engineer from the Netherlands and I

changed my career to Tech in record time

by leveraging my not taking system that

is my secret weapon two weeks ago I

introduced you to the P method and

hopefully you have started to build the

habit of taking notes in your own words

and today we're going to be making the

first step towards note taking Mastery

we are going to be diving to a life

altering approach to managing knowledge

which is called the tle Casten method

after thousands of hours of trying

different no taking systems I finally

have arrived at this about a or year ago

that's when I really started to

implement the settle CM method

completely and I can tell you after

these thousands of hours this is the

right one this is the one to shoot for

it's difficult but it's it's it's it's

going to be giving you so much if you

adopt

this so in our information Rich world

the ability to process and retain and

synthesize knowledge is crucial

especially for us devops engineers and

software

Engineers our field is just constantly

changing and there is always new

developments coming up there's always

new things that we need to learn and you

just can't keep up with it if you try to

remember everything that's why we need

to

externalize our our learning our our

thinking our memory that's what a good

notetaking system comes into so the tle

Caston method is the crown jewel of not

taking

methods this is a horrible attempt at a

crown so this is

a it really is the crown jewel of noing

methods it was created by Nicholas Lumen

he is a German sociologist lumen

and he is seen as one of the most

prolific scholars in

history Pro by prolific we mean that he

produced a lot of output he was very

productive he wrote almost seven yeah he

wrote 70 books and more than 400

academic articles now 70 books that's

almost two books a

year two books a year that's a lot and

and usually like if an academ MC

produces a book every 3 years that is

considered to be a significant

achievement so this guy was producing

two books a year and like I highly

suggest taking a look at his writing

let's take a look at his writing this is

an

essay uh called communicating with slip

boxes it's his essay on the settle cast

method and uh let's see

um here let's the point I want to make

is that this is not just just fluff

writing this is very deep thinking that

this man is doing in his writing here

information is an INT systematic event

it results when One Compares One message

or entry with regard to other

possibilities information accordingly

originates only in systems which possess

a comparative schema even if this

amounts only to this or something

else for communication we do not have to

presuppose that both parties use the

same compar ative schema the effect of

surprise even increases when this is not

the case and when you believe a message

like this is deep thick academic writing

it's amazing I love it but the point is

that he was not just producing fluff he

was actually like putting out quality

content in an insane High insanely High

degree so I like to say when you learn

painting you look at master of rembrand

and and DaVinci well in terms of writing

productivity Lumen is my

DaVinci at the time of his death his

ttle cast contained 990,000 index cards

and and you can you can see the

thing Lumen settle gasten it uh let's

see there are pictures yeah this is a

picture of his actual settle

cast it then this is just one of the

cabinets and he had multiple of these

cabinets and all of those were index

cards and it when he died it contained

90,000 index

cards so before I dive what the into

what these these index cards are and

what they do Etc I just want to briefly

mention that the price of my school

Community is going to rise to $35 a

month on the 1st of August but the way

the school pricing model works is that

if you get in for the current price of

$29 a month you will always stay at that

price level no matter how much more it

will rise in the future which it will so

if you get in for $29 a month now you

will always keep at that price level and

when you get in you get access to all of

my not taking courses you get access to

my full ttle Caston method course and um

you can uh get access to me directly by

asking questions in the Q&A calls we

have Q&A calls every week and you can

ask questions by creating posts and I

respond to you uh usually within a day

so this is the this is your way to ask

me questions directly the price is

increasing to $35 on the 1st of August

so if you want to get in for $29 and

save $72 a year this is your time to

jump in now let's get back to the settle

cast method

people like to make this ttle Casten

method really

complex but it's

actually very

simple and the the kiss principle

applies here keep it simple stupid like

people create these elaborate videos and

and it's very

simple tlec is a Nott taking and

personal Knowledge Management

System it is a German word where tle

means slip as in slip of

paper and

Casten

meaning

crate or box so putting papers in a box

that is what tle Casten

means originally it was a physical box

holding index cards like we saw in the

picture

and each index card contains a single

idea or unit of

information and then the key is that

each of these cards they would contain a

number in his physical system so he had

multiple cards and all of them had

numbers and then by referencing that

number on the cards he could link those

cards to other cards and this way he

could build up arguments consisting of

these little building blocks and he

could take the cards out and he could

move them around and he could build

things and create unexpected connections

by keeping one idea to one card and by

all of this interlinking he was creating

this hyper text this Web of Knowledge

which was stored outside of of his brain

this is what Lumen was doing so this is

what the key of the s cast

method so there

are several principles of the settle

cast method the first one

is atomic notes so this is what I refer

to already that each index card contains

one discrete

idea two interconnectedness so there is

the linking of the

cards three

emergent structure

so

structure

so instead of like in the para method

you start with a list of projects and

then you put those category your your

folder your notes into those folders

into those categories the tle cast

method Works differently you do not

start with a pre supposed structure you

let that that structure come organically

by linking the

notes and but in digital tools we can

link these notes by for example creating

markdown links but in his physical box

he did not have a a structure to it it

was um the notes were always staying in

a fixed place so he would just start

with a drawer and just add adding cards

to it without any sort of structure with

the the like the philosophy goes in here

and gardening goes in here no he didn't

do anything like that the notes always

had a fixed address in the in the box

and he would just keep adding them

without regard of placement or

categories and then he used the linking

as the way to provide structure which

would evolve

organically and and number

four a very important part of the

principles is uh own

words so no quotes or very

sparingly Luman never highlighted uh

text in his in his books he always wrote

down the concepts in his own words Lumen

almost never used quotes on his tettles

he always converted to it to his own

words so instead of

saying instead of directly quoting the

author he would just write oh on page so

and so the author makes this and that

compelling argument and I think that it

is opposed to that argument that you can

find in this ttle that's how he would

use these

tettles so the ttle cast is not just

just a not taking system like the par

method tle Casten is more than that the

tle Caston is a thinking

tool

so the par method and and other no

methods they rely heavily on

highlighting text copying quotes but

Lumen never did that like I said it it

you always write in your own words and

when you do this you engage in a process

that's similar to translation as if

you're translation translating to a

different language it forces you to

think deeply about the material and by

writing in your own words you ensure

that you truly understand it before you

put it into your notetaking

system so when you find yourself unable

to rephrase an idea or to to write it

down in your own words it's it's a very

clear indication that you haven't fully

grasped it yet and as I've discussed in

a previous letter the act of writing

itself is crucial for understanding

writing is

understanding so by avoiding to use

direct quotes and crafting each note in

your own word you're processing it

you're you're internalizing

it and

secondly when when you have this system

of index cards and he would use physical

index cards I don't use physical IND

index cards although I would like to do

it but I do it in in obsidian but when

you have a series of notes all related

to each other about some sort of topic

when you are building a super complex

argument that this guy was doing then

you can take these notes and then you

can move them around on your desk you

can arrange them in different orders and

you can see how this argument might fit

better over here it might fit better

over there and this is the power of

making these notes Atomic that every

note is just one

idea and then you can you can start

seeing structures you can start seeing

relations to notes that were not there

at all before

by keeping these these ideas

bite-sized you can you can really start

to externalize your thoughts and work

with complex arguments which are really

difficult to keep in your head

constantly it's much much easier to have

them laid out on the table before you so

in essence tle Casten transforms no

taking from from just passive recording

you are not you're not recording

or capturing information you not just

this is why I I don't I always advise

against these these clipping apps or

these readwise apps or just highlights

that pull everything straight into your

obsidian Vault I'm highly against that

actually instead of like just hoarding

text that somebody else wrote The Settle

castom becomes a thinking tool you you

use your own brain you use your own

thinking to create your own words you

craft your own words you craft your own

insights so in the coming weeks we are

going to be delving more into the ttle

cast method method I'm going to explain

exactly how it enhances your

productivity how you can use it to

create output how you can um really

increase your your

learning your work as a knowledge worker

and and your output as a Creator if that

is what you are interested in so that's

what we'll be looking at in the in the

few in next coming weeks but if you want

to start taking notes using the ttle

cast method today you should consider my

course I'm totally confident that it's

the most comprehensive resource on

learning settle

cast on the internet today it already

has what is it 9918

um students on udemy already it has

almost perfect F five star reviews but

if you join my school Community for $29

a day a month if you join my community

today you will always keep paying the

price you get unlimited access to my

courses and you can just do the ttle

cast method and ask me questions about

it directly to me if you get stuck so

that's a huge advantage of joining my

community instead of just doing a oneoff

course purchase so thank you so much for

watching and hope to see you in the next

video have a good week
