I've been building my second brain system for many years and I have arrived at a system that works really well for me

but I'm about to

change it completely so I figured this

would be a good time to capture what

I've been doing for the past year or so

and to uh tell you what I'm going to be

doing next

so to start off I am waiting for the

memory to arrive for my new Arch Linux

system I'm going to be going back to

daily driving Linux and moving away from

my Mac OS which means that I'm also

moving away from certain elements of the

Apple ecosystem and um my system

currently is based mostly on Apple the

Apple solutions to things and um as I'm

moving away from that I'll need to find

solutions for that Alternatives that can

run on Linux so I figured this would be

a good time to capture it so let's dive

into it first of all what is a second

brain now Thiago Forte he is kind of the

the the father of the term he's the one

who who came up with the term I believe

he he wrote a book about it and his

definition is an external centralized

digital repository for the things you

learn and the resources from which they

come a second brain ultimately expands

your memory and your intellect to modern

tools of Technology

and basically that is more like the

noing system to me that is the that is

not the entire second brain because in

my definition the the the second brain

is broader than that it encompasses more

so my definition

is a personalized interconnected system

of digital tools and methods designed to

externalize cognitive processes and

information

management it encompasses no taking task

and time management communication

handling and content

curation that is my definition of a

second

brain the main goal of a second brain is

to offload these tasks to A system that

can be trusted which allows the user to

have an empty mind at all times which

can be utilized for deep thinking

creation and problem

solving this is my definition of a

second brain so it's personalized you

build it yourself it's

interconnected so you have Bring It's a

a a meeting point of several digital

tools and methods designed to

externalize cognitive processes and

information management so the whole idea

is to create a system Des designed for

you to offload cognitive processes that

means that you can have more space in

your mind for Creative work for for

problem solving and for deep

thinking so the I this is from getting

things done the idea is to create a

system that you can trust that you can

use to offload things to so uh it it it

really helps me at least to have a

certain place where I put things knowing

I will get back to those later for

example the note inbox that I have been

harping on in my note taking videos I

can put the notes there and I have a

routine in place that causes me to

return back to that inbox so I know that

my notes are being

processed now the core elements of a

second brain are a not taking system

well I've T talk talked at length about

that uh it is a task manager an email

client a cal

and a way of content scheduling so I'm

going to be walking you through all of

the solutions that I'm currently using

and I will uh show you and I I'll speak

to a bit on how I plan to solve these

things so starting off with my not

taking system well I've created enough

videos about that now it is my tlec

based on obsidian but I mainly interact

with my tle Casten through neovim as you

see here so that is the core of the

whole the whole thing it's a no taking

system and note that things like task

management and content scheduling can

happen inside the no taking system I

have tried that but I have come to the

conclusion that it's better to separate

those out I always had this idea that

obsidian should be this One-Stop shop

for everything I try to put in task

management I put I try to put everything

in there and I don't know where I got

this notion from that I needed to have

everything in obsidian but my conclusion

is that it doesn't work no taking

obsidian is a not taking app and you

should use it for taking notes very

simple but keep it simple like do one

thing and do it well and then choose

another program that does for example

task management well because task

management in obsidian it doesn't work

well is my conclusion after years of

experimentation so the not taking system

is only for my notes that's where I put

my notes it's my ttle cast I use that

for deep thinking for writing for

creating content that's where my notes

live second there is the task manager so

I use apple reminders for my tasks and I

divide these up into several lists and

you can see here that I also use the par

method in my task

management it's not too straight but I

do use it so here is my my areas these

are several lists and here I have a

school list for example for my school

community and say I I I want to schedule

a few to-dos that I need to do I would

say for example record intro video and

Etc and I that's how I would organize my

tasks secondly I have projects here so

there are several projects that I'm

working on and then I gather all of the

tasks related to that project and when I

when the time comes for me to work in

that project I just open that list and

then I will uh start taking off the

tasks that I

want and one I also use this for um

scheduling things to do someday right

like so I I just randomly put in tasks

and ideas in there that I want to do

someday when I have time and when when I

am never bored but if the event happens

that I am bored I can get into those

lists and just try to find some things

to do and I also have a routines list

here and this is very useful because

then for example every two weeks I

change my bed sheets and then I I re

then I'm reminded that I need to do that

uh I have my watering plans scheduled

every Sunday it is just very useful for

me to use it um to have these recurring

reminders but the best thing about Apple

reminder

is the fact that it integrates so well

with the entire Apple

ecosystem so this is synced to my watch

my my phone my iPad and my MacBook here

so the great thing about this is that if

I am going about my work in the house

I'm just doing something and then

suddenly I think of something that I

need to do well what I would do is then

I would open Siri on my Apple eyewatch I

would say set a reminder today 1

pm what do you want to be reminded about

call

Grandma okay I added call Grandma for

this afternoon at300 hours so it is

added on my list on my eyewatch and then

after a few minutes it will show up on

this uh reminders list here so this is

very powerful because that means that

wherever I am I can within seconds

offload my

task during any activity I don't have to

carry a notebook I don't have to process

a notebook it is just with me all the

time I can be out running and then when

I'm running I just usually a lot I do a

lot of thinking while running and then I

can just constantly offload these tasks

into my eyewatch and it all gets synced

to my reminders and then I can process

those later so that is extremely

powerful of the Apple ecosystem that all

of this stuff is working together so

this is the main one that I'll need to

get a solution for this is a main

problem that I need to solve with uh uh

my move to back to Linux I need to find

a way that I can speak into my eyewatch

and that it syncs to some sort of uh

task manager that also syncs to Linux so

that is the first part that I need to

solve but that is how I handle my tasks

using Apple reminders and the main

reason for it is that I can speak into

my eyewatch and then it gets synced to

all of my

devices so that's is my task

manager so next we have email and for

that I am using the normal native mail

uh app on on Mac OS so this is the Apple

Mail and obviously I can't show my

emails and my email addresses but what I

what I've been using is

the native Apple Mail app which has been

really useful because I I Ed the the

smart mailboxes function to to filter

certain mails and put them in mailboxes

that I can process later because the

thing is I I used to have a very

shameful um mail setup I was just using

the browser with Gmail and I have

several email addresses and I was

checking them separately and it was just

a mess and just a few months ago when I

started my business I knew I I needed to

get a grip on my email and that's when I

started to just consolidate everything

into one app and just that step has been

super useful already and the next uh

iter the next iteration was to then

start smart filtering those emails and

the just the simple step of putting

everything into one app has been

gamechanging because then I really

started to realize how much mail I was

getting because the the the the main

goal is to get to inbox zero right you

want to have empty inboxes and you don't

want to use your email as a task

management email is not a task

management solution don't keep mails in

your mailbox as tasks no you schedule

the tasks that you need to do in your

task manager and then you archive the

email email is for email not for task

management

and this has been instrumental in my own

Journey so I use the native Apple Mail

app for now uh it has been quite okay it

the only annoying thing is that it uses

arrow keys and certain key bindings and

I can't set up key Vim key bindings for

it and that is something that I will

need to solve and I plan to use Mozilla

Thunderbird for this because obviously I

don't have apple mail on Arch Linux and

I will need need a separate email client

where I can consolidate everything and

that is what I'm thinking of using

Mozilla Thunderbird I've been trying it

on my ThinkPad and uh it it works well

and I think that's going to be the one

that I'm going to go

for next there is the calendar solution

so for that I use Apple calendar I have

a pretty um pretty um nice setup for my

my my calendar I schedule my day and as

you see there is a lot of free time in

here that I can schedule freely some

weeks I plan everything very

meticulously some weeks I leave more

open time I'm just working on one big

project and then I don't need to

actually schedule everything but there

are several things that are uh scheduled

recurringly so for example some cleaning

that I do on Sunday there are my my

scheduled meetings with the school

community

and so forth so this is how I U manage

my calendar and the app the Apple

calendar works really well it syncs with

my work work uh calendars it it it it

schedules it syncs with all of the

calendars that I have I have a few like

a personal one and the the work one and

they all consolidate into one which is

nice and I think I can find a similar

some solution for that on Linux that

shouldn't be much of a problem problem

if not I might have to fix may maybe use

my Synology for that I don't know but

there should be a solution for that for

that will

work and then finally there is content

scheduling and this is a very important

part of a second brain so it's all about

becoming intentional about your content

scheduling you don't want to just sit on

YouTube and refresh and and let the

algorithm decide what you want to watch

no

you you curate a list of things that you

want to consume which you are

recommended by friends or that you

encounter during other research and then

you watch only that list you

don't just randomly browse yeah you can

do that sometimes but if if you just let

the algorithm decide what to do sorry

but you're not going to get anywhere in

life you need to take control of what

you consume and what you curate and what

you take notes on this is how I have

come so far as I have today by becoming

intentional about the content

consumption it's not a Content

consumption for learning is something

that you do intentionally with intention

with attention taking notes with full

focus and not just randomly letting the

algorithm decide so I just simply use

the watch later list on on YouTube for

that I've recently you can clean that

using scripts I recently cleaned that

entire thing with scripts and I

restarted it but you I just schedule

things on watch later as I encounter

them and then I

uh watch them as I have the time and

then there is RSS feeds so I use a

selfhosted comma feed that's running on

my kubernetes cluster and here are

certain RSS feeds that I uh subscribe to

and then when I when I get the time I go

through them and I read them and I

process them and that is how I um will

how how I schedule my basically the

things that I

follow and also there is wab bag that I

use so let's see am I logged in here no

I'm not logged in there in here on my

current new browser I switched to cube

browser recently I haven't logged in yet

but here I save all the articles that I

come across and then I can read them at

my own Leisure when I uh when I have the

time so the idea is to always to curate

a list of reading of content consumption

for yourself and then read them later as

you get to it don't just do it in the

moment or randomly browse no you you

schedule blocks of time of okay now I'm

going to be reading for a while or now

I'm going to watch some videos I need to

relax I need to watch some

videos and that is how you become

intentional with your time so that is

how I uh uh do that so for those those

are already on selfhosted options with

my RSS feeds and my wallet bag so I

don't need any other uh solutions for

those uh so the main things that I need

to solve are my uh task manager my email

client is probably solved and I need to

find a way for my calendar to to

fix so that is my entire uh second brain

system the note taking and then bringing

all of the messages and all of the

things together in one place and then

that I can schedule for later processing

that is how I do it now let I will speak

a little bit on why I want to move away

from Mac OS uh recently I did a video on

why

I um why I felt stuck on Mac OS and

windows as a content creator and ever

since I created that video I felt this

really strong desire to go back to Linux

to go to a system that I absolutely

control and this was completely

solidified when Apple recently came out

with these um with these announcements

that are they are going to be

integrating AI into Mac

OS I don't like that I don't like that

it's going to happen and yes they are

saying it's all local or it's being sent

to our private Cloud all encrypted sure

and I I kind of trust Apple I I'm not

that concerned about the privacy but the

thing is I don't want AI in

everything that I do I hate getting AI

generated emails from people if you

can't have the time to just send me an

email with your own thoughts then don't

bother emailing me if I see an emo an

email with all of these emojis and this

this

generic AI generated fluff man I I get

so angry I don't like that at all and I

want to get that as far away as possible

from my operating system and I hope

apple is going to be allowing you to

turn it off but actually I I don't think

you can and that is the biggest reason

for me to start moving away from Mac OS

and apple even though I think it's great

I love it but I want to have more

control over what's going on on my

system and especially keep all of that

AI out of my everything that I do

because uh AI I I have nothing against

AI but I use it I use AI every day but I

use it intentionally I want to be in

control when I send something to an AI

and I want to be in control how I use it

and what I use it for I don't want it

integrated in everything that I do I

hate this trend that things are

everything has to be integrated with AI

every it's AI everywhere chatbots

everywhere I don't like it and that is

the main reason I want to move away from

from

mechos but still I am going to be using

using my iPhone and my eyewatch and for

everything so I'm not moving away from

the Apple ecosystem as such I just need

a good way to integrate everything with

uh in in my second brain that is

compatible with both Mac OS with iOS and

Linux so that is the process that I'm

going to be embarking on as my memory

arrives hopefully today so I'll be

building my Arch Linux system in the

next few weeks and I'm going to be

releasing videos about it so hope to see

you in those videos and thank you so

much for watching today hope this was

useful to you and to see to see how I

have how I solve these things using the

Apple ecosystem using one program for

one thing and doing one thing well and

um I'll keep you updated on the progress

on my second brain when I move to Linux

have a good day
