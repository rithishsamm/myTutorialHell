# **Notes for both projects:**

- For each website, we will create a dev-WordPress-site for you on our host (WPEngine), here you can do all of your work, once all work is completed and approved our dev will move the dev-site to production.
- After project completion (and handover to our Digital team), we expect to be able to edit all elements within each template that you create for us, e.g. be able to change background colours, font style/size/colour, text, images, videos, button links and CTA text, icons, etc.

# **First project: CPActive**

**Site:** CPActive website [https://cpactive.org.au/](https://cpactive.org.au/) 
**Description**: is a WordPress website using custom CSS, it was built by an external agency and we're now looking to bring it inhouse (i.e. our Digital team to manage/maintain the website moving forward); in order to bring the website inhouse we need to rebuild the website with Elementor, reason being that our Digital team are familiar with Elementor. We want to copy/paste the existing website using Elementor.**

13 static page website(Simple pages not complicated one) convert into New WordPress Elementor website. The new site should replicate the current website exactly in terms of content, colors, styles (CSS), images, and all associated assets.
