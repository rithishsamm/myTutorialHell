## Clock’s ticking: action on exam support now!

Young people all across Australia will be taking their high school exams in a few months and are preparing for this milestone – but not everyone will have a fair go or have access to the supports they need to do their best.

Unfortunately, supports currently available to students with disability can be poor, inconsistent, or altogether non-existent, making it even more difficult for us to excel at this upcoming milestone exam. 

CPActive is calling on NSW government to ensure clear, consistent and enforceable guidelines for support around assessments at schools for students living with disability. 

The clock’s ticking – because high school assessments are just around the corner.  

High school students with CP and similar disabilities deserve clear, consistent and enforceable guidelines around assessments this HSC year.  

**The clock’s ticking – we want action now on exam supports.** 

Will you sign the petition to show your support for fair exams, and clear, consistent guidelines for supports around assessments at school?

Young people all across Australia will be taking their high school exams in a few months and are preparing for this milestone – but not everyone will have a fair go or have access to the supports they need to do their best.

Young people with disability have the right to communicate our knowledge, skills and ideas in ways that work for us, and the right to appropriate supports that meets our individual needs so we can excel.

Unfortunately, supports currently available to students with disability can be poor, inconsistent, or altogether non-existent, making it even more difficult for us to excel at this upcoming milestone exam.

CPActive is calling on governments at every level across Australia to ensure clear, consistent and enforceable guidelines for support around assessments at schools for students living with disability.

Our Blaze the Trail Campaign fired up our community last year when the NSW government committed to our policy asks for improved pathways from school to work, which were:

1. Clear, consistent, and enforceable guidelines for support around assessments at school and university for students living with disability
2. Pathways for people living with disability to enter the teaching workforce
3. A state-wide initiative supporting the development of pathways for students living with disability into large business, government departments and community organisations

We met with Kate Washington, Minister for Disability Inclusion, to talk about what progress has been made with delivering on these asks.

While NSW Labor tell us they want to see these changes, these promises haven’t been delivered as quickly as we hoped.

We know politics moves slow – but young people with disabilities need support now.

So it’s time to remind them how important this is for our community and how ready we are to work together and make this happen.

The clock’s ticking – because high school assessments are just around the corner.

High school students with CP and similar disabilities deserve clear, consistent and enforceable guidelines around assessments this HSC year.

**The clock’s ticking – we want action now on exam supports.**

Will you sign the petition to show your support for fair exams, and clear, consistent guidelines for supports around assessments at school?
