## About CPActive

CPActive is an advocacy campaign from Cerebral Palsy Alliance, a not-for-profit disability service and research organisation which helps thousands of Australians with cerebral palsy and similar disabilities.

The CPActive community brings together people with disability, families, disability workers and allies who are passionate about creating positive, lasting change for people with disability. Our goal is to amplify the voices of lived experience to make sure people with disability have a say on the issues that affect them.

Whether it’s in the halls of government or our local neighbourhood, CPActive campaigns for a society where every voice is valued and every Australian is empowered to live life to the fullest.

## Cerebral Palsy Alliance

Cerebral Palsy Alliance provides family-centred therapies, life skills programs, equipment and support for people and their families living with cerebral palsy and similar disabilities.

Cerebral Palsy Alliance exists to help babies, children, teenagers and adults living with cerebral palsy and similar conditions to lead the most comfortable, independent and inclusive lives possible. Its therapy teams work with individuals and families to maximise their participation in the community. Cerebral Palsy Alliance operates from 132 sites throughout metropolitan, regional and rural NSW and the ACT.

As well as providing services and supports, [Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation](https://cerebralpalsy.org.au/our-research/research-foundation-and-institute/our-research-institute/) was founded in 2005 to accelerate life-changing research for the condition, and is now the largest private funder of CP research in the world. In parallel to its impressive research agenda, the organisation’s technology accelerator, [Remarkable](https://remarkable.org.au/), is supporting early stage disability-tech start-ups across Australia to become viable businesses.
