# **Notes for both projects:**

- For each website, we will create a dev-WordPress-site for you on our host (WPEngine), here you can do all of your work, once all work is completed and approved our dev will move the dev-site to production.
- After project completion (and handover to our Digital team), we expect to be able to edit all elements within each template that you create for us, e.g. be able to change background colors, font style/size/color, text, images, videos, button links and CTA text, icons, etc.
