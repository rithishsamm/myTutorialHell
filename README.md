### 🚀 Get Started

## Course Introduction
Here's the  **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rithishsamm/DevSecOpsground)🔗**

DevSecOps is all about People, Process and Tools. In this course, you will understand the basics of DevSecOps and learn to do DevSecOps with Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, Azure DevSecOps and Jenkins. You will learn to implement DevSecOps with Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Infrastructure as Code. You will play with 3 different clouds - AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.

You will learn the basics of Kubernetes on the Google Kubernetes Engine implementing Service Discovery, Centralized Configuration and Load Balancing for Microservices. You will do DevSecOps with Kubernetes using Terraform (Infrastructure as Code) and Azure DevSecOps (Continuous Delivery) on multiple cloud platforms (AWS and Azure)

You will learn the basics of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery and implement them using Jenkins and Azure DevSecOps. You will learn to Create Kubernetes Clusters and Deploy Microservices to Kubernetes using Azure DevSecOps Pipelines on the Cloud with AWS EKS and Azure AKS.

You will learn the basics of Terraform and Ansible and implement Infrastructure as Code. You will provision a number of AWS Resources - EC2 Instances and Load Balancers - using Terraform and configure them with Ansible. You will learn to provision Kubernetes Clusters in AWS and Azure using Terraform. You would learn to run Terraform Configuration in Azure DevSecOps Pipelines.

This course would be a perfect first step as an introduction to DevSecOps.




## Requirements
